    Same discovery rule for every archive: a record with its own Gaia
    source_id is trusted outright (Gaia's own catalog is the "is this real"
    check already); a record with only a raw_target_name gets that name
    batch-resolved via SIMBAD and kept only if SIMBAD calls it stellar (see
    resolve_stellar_gaia_ids_batch). Records with neither are left for
    sync.matcher's positional fallback against whatever's already tracked.

    Shared between sync.runner (incremental production syncs) and
    scripts.seed_small_test_data (one-off bulk seeding) so the two can't
    silently diverge in what counts as a new star.

    Returns names_attempted/names_resolved alongside stars_added — added
    specifically because this was previously invisible: More Info's "a
    small fraction of names don't resolve" claim was written from a single
    archive's own bespoke, unrepresentative counter (carmenes.py's cursor),
    not real data from this shared function every archive actually goes
