"""Match raw archive observation records against tracked stars.

Three paths, in priority order — identifier match first, position as backup
only, matching the "easy match first" design (full likelihood-ratio matching
is still deferred):

- direct_gaia_column: the archive already reports a Gaia source_id — just
  check it's one of ours.
- name_resolved: no Gaia column, but the record's raw_target_name matches one
  of a tracked star's cached SIMBAD aliases. Tried before positional matching
  because position can fail even when correctly propagated — Gaia's
  single-star astrometric fit can be biased for binaries/crowded fields (seen
  live: a CFHT/CADC record for Stein 2051 A, a known visual binary, missed
  its positional match despite correct proper motion — its identifier would
  have caught it). Identifier match sidesteps that entirely. Still sanity-
  checked against the record's own reported position when one is present
  (see NAME_MATCH_SANITY_RADIUS_ARCSEC): "Mira" is SIMBAD's own proper name
  for omicron Ceti *and* an informal class label for any Mira-type
  long-period variable, so an archive using "Mira" generically for some
  other physical star would otherwise be silently merged onto omicron
  Ceti's gaia_source_id. A record whose name matches but whose own position
  is nowhere near that star falls through to positional matching instead of
  being trusted blindly. If that fallback also finds no positional
  candidate, the record lands in needs_review rather than skipped — a
  rejected name match is a real, often-correct candidate (e.g. the archive's
  own logged position for that one exposure is simply wrong, not evidence of
  a different star: an HR9070/LQ And record 49 degrees from where that star
  is is still SIMBAD-confirmed to be the correct alias regardless), so it's
  worth a human's attention rather than being silently dropped.
- positional_easy_match: only for records that didn't identifier-match. A
  q3c-indexed radial query (see _load_candidate_stars) narrows the tracked
  star list down to a small spatially-relevant candidate set per observation
  epoch, those get their proper motion propagated to the observation's
  epoch, then it's a tight-radius match against the raw record's position —
  using only our own tracked star list as the candidate catalog (not the
  full Gaia catalog — deferred along with full LR matching). Exactly one
  star within radius -> matched; more than one -> needs_review (ambiguous);
  zero -> the record isn't one of ours and is silently skipped (bulk archive
  tables hold far more objects than we track).

# name-resolved matches (2017-2023), n large enough that this is many-sigma
# significant, not noise. Not a single fixed vector though -- ruled out
# proper motion (corr with pmra/pmdec ~ -0.03/-0.06) and per-program causes
# (every row shares program_id='smarts', no finer tagging). RA-offset and
# Dec-offset are anti-correlated with each other (r=-0.62) and the median
# RA offset grows with declination -- the signature of a real pointing-model
# residual (this telescope's own spec page lists an equatorial mount, first
# light 1968, permanently on one side of the pier -- a plausible source of
# uncorrected polar-axis/non-perpendicularity terms), not per-exposure
# randomness. Radius chosen by simulating several candidates against
# spectroscopy_holdings' existing skipped/needs_review chiron rows -- see
# scripts/simulate_match_radius.py -- and picking the one that maximizes
# clean (single-candidate) recoveries before ambiguity (needs_review) takes
# over. Clean recoveries rise from 8,875 at 20" to a peak of
# 13,021 at 60", then *fall* to 11,190 at 90" as more of them pick up a
# second nearby candidate faster than new ones appear -- 60" is the actual
# optimum, not just "wide enough."
#
# eso/FEROS: median offset (RA, Dec) = (-59.6", +23.5") across 48k
# name-resolved matches (2003-2026), tightly clustered (90th-percentile
# separation only 99" vs. a 75" median -- most of the mass sits in a narrow
# band, unlike a random-mismatch tail). Ruled out proper motion and epoch
# drift the same way as chiron (both correlations ~0). Simulated the same
# way: clean recoveries peak at 100" (20,635, essentially flat 95-105")
# before ambiguity takes over past ~120" -- matches the 99" p90 almost
# exactly, so 100" captures the real offset population without yet
# overreaching into denser fields.
#
# Evaluated and excluded: gemini/NIFS has an even tighter,
# more persistent offset (median separation 180", 90th percentile only
# 187" -- essentially a fixed vector, stable 2005-2024) most likely because
# NIFS's tiny IFU sits off the acquisition camera's optical axis on the
# focal plane, and Gemini's alt-az mount rotates that fixed instrumental
# offset's RA/Dec projection with parallactic angle. But NIFS targets sit
# in far more crowded fields: simulated clean recoveries peak at just 80"
# (4,961) and are already declining by 100" -- by the radius needed to
# actually reach the real ~180" offset, ambiguous matches (11,929) outnumber
# clean ones (2,191) more than 5:1. Unlike chiron/FEROS, widening the radius
