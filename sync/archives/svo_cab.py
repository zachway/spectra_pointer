"""SVO CAB stellar libraries (Spanish Virtual Observatory, CAB/INTA-CSIC) — SSA.

Five small, curated, empirical stellar spectral libraries hosted on the same
DaCHS-flavored SVOCat SSA stack at svo2.cab.inta-csic.es/vocats, same
one-archive-many-instruments shape as oirsa.py -- one shared query function
parameterized by sub-collection path, each row labeled by which library it
came from. Observed, 2026-08-07:

  - MILES     (v3/miles)     -- 985 bright reference stars.
  - STELIB    (v2/stelib)    -- 256 stars.
  - XSL       (v3/xshooter)  -- 912 stars (X-Shooter Spectral Library).
  - CaT       (v2/catlib)    -- 696 stars (Ca II Triplet calibration lib).
  - GBS       (gbs)          -- 241 stars (Gaia FGK Benchmark Stars) -- note
    the different path shape observed: "vocats/gbs/ssap.php", not
    "vocats/v3/gbs/...".

This host 302-redirects every request to svocats.cab.inta-csic.es -- a
bare `curl` without `-L` silently returns an apparently-empty-but-200
response, easy to mistake for "no data here". `requests` follows
redirects by default so this is a non-issue for this module, but worth
noting for anyone testing the endpoint manually.

These are SSA cone-search services, not TAP, but each one's own search-form
help text says "Maximum Search Radius allowed: 180 degrees" -- a genuine
radius, not the IVOA SSA spec's usual "diameter" reading, observed by
querying MILES from two different POS centers (equatorial and polar) with
SIZE=180: identical ~985-row result both times, which a true hemisphere-only
diameter reading could not produce for an all-sky reference-star library.
So a single SIZE=180 query from any POS (0,0 used here) pulls each library's
*entire* catalog in one page -- no pagination, no sky-grid crawl needed at
all, unlike irsa_missions.py's iso_sws/iras_lrs (this project initially
planned for a grid crawl here per the age-old cone-search-only assumption,
but the confirmed-live radius behavior made that unnecessary).

Column names are NOT uniform across the five services (each is configured
independently in SVOCat) -- observed, per collection: the per-row
target-name field is "objname" (MILES, CaT), "name" (STELIB, XSL), or "star"
(GBS); see COLLECTIONS below for the explicit per-collection mapping used
instead of any generic utype-sniffing. Position is uniform, though: every
service exposes a "TargetPos" field (SSA Target.Pos, [ra, dec] in degrees),
observed to be populated on 100% of rows across all five (zero masked
positions in any of them).

No real per-observation date on four of the five: these are static, one-shot
curated libraries (each star observed once, long ago, for the reference
compilation), same "no observation date" shape as feros_gavo.py/rave.py --
observed, no Epoch/mjd-shaped field exists at all for MILES, STELIB,
CaT, or GBS. XSL is the one exception: it carries a real "Epoch" field (MJD)
-- populated on 245 of 912 fits-format rows observed (masked on the
rest, presumably for spectra ingested from the original ESO archive without
a preserved observation date) -- read via clean_float, left None when masked
rather than guessed.

Each real spectrum is served in three parallel formats (VOTable/ASCII/FITS,
"SpecFmt" field) sharing one "AssocID" -- filtered to SpecFmt=='application/
fits' to get one row per real object rather than tripling every count.
CaT additionally serves a paired *error* spectrum under its own AssocID for
every real spectrum (observed: exactly 696 "spec_fits" + 696
"errsp_fits" rows, both formatted application/fits) -- excluded via a
substring check on SpecURL's "errsp"/"spec" label, the same kind of
mime/label-based dedup feros_gavo.py uses for its own paired VOTable/FITS
rows.

archive_url points at "SpecURL" (the real per-row spectrum file link, e.g.
".../miles/ssap.php?ID=0685&label=spec_fits"), not "access_url" (a DataLink
descriptor wrapper around the same file, one extra hop for no benefit here).

No native Gaia column on any of these five (positional/name matching only,
same as most archives here). archive_obs_id is "<collection>:<AssocID>" --
AssocID alone is only unique within one library's own table, not across all
five sharing this one archive_code.

Final, static datasets (none of these five libraries has grown since its
original publication) -- one full pull is enough forever, so fetch() is a
no-op once the cursor marks it done, same shape as rave.py/feros_gavo.py.

webapp/app.py's INSTRUMENT_RESOLVING_POWER/INSTRUMENT_WAVELENGTH_RANGE_NM
deliberately have no entry for Gaia FGK Benchmark Stars -- its own per-row
"instrument" field (visible in the raw SSA response, e.g. "ESPaDOnS_tauCet",
"HARPS.Archive_tauCet", "NARVAL_tauCet") shows this collection is itself a
compilation of high-resolution spectra pulled from several different
underlying spectrographs, not one instrument with one citable resolving
power -- same reasoning several other archives here give for omitting a
mixed/uncertain entry rather than guessing a single number.
