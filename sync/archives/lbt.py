"""LBT — PEPSI, MODS, LUCI, via a real IVOA TAP service.

archive.lbto.org (a Vue.js SPA, "portal-gui") calls a TAP endpoint at
https://archive.lbto.org/tap — found by grepping the app's own JS bundle
for URL literals, not documented anywhere findable. The `lbt` schema has
one table per instrument (irtc, lbc, lbt, lbti, luci, mods, pepsi, pis).
Originally scoped to pepsi alone (spectroscopy-only, no imaging mode at
all); extended to mods and luci, which mix imaging and spectroscopy in
the same table — each has its own `dataprod` column with a clean
'spectrum'/'image'/'' split (observed via DISTINCT), unlike pepsi
which has no such column at all (imagetyp='object' does that job there
instead). Not a uniform schema across instruments at all: mods/luci don't
have pepsi's `lbtra`/`lbtde` columns either — see INSTRUMENTS below.

No ObsCore, no access_url column — position columns (where present) are
sexagesimal strings (not decimal degrees, unlike every other TAP-based
archive here), parsed via astropy.

pepsi's own `ra`/`dec` columns looked like the obvious position field but
are NOT usable as target position — observed against production data:
a consistent ~17-20 arcmin offset from every sampled target's true Gaia
position, tight enough to be systematic (unlike a genuine mismatch or
per-record archive glitch, which scatter far more randomly). `lbtra`/`lbtde`
(also on this table) matches the true position to within 0.01-0.03 arcmin
on the same sample and is used instead — same telescope-pointing role as
luci's telra/teldec below, just under a different name on this table.

mods has per-target objra/objdec, but only ~56% populated (observed:
1132/2000 spectrum rows) — the literal string 'none' is a real sentinel
for missing, not just masked/empty, so it's checked for explicitly. luci
has no per-target position column at all, only telra/teldec (telescope
pointing, not target position) — used as a best-effort stand-in; real for
on-axis pointings, an approximation for anything with a slit/IFU offset.
Not solved further here, same "accept present limitations" stance as the
matcher's own documented Stein 2051 A case.

archive_url points at the general search portal, not a specific file: the
only real download mechanism is an async job system (submit the entire
search-form state as a job, poll /jobs, extract a result URL from the
completed job) — observed, no direct-file URL and no query-param
deep-link exist. That's designed for bulk "download my whole search"
workflows, not per-file lookups, and implementing it just to construct
one URL column would be wildly disproportionate to how every other
archive here works.

`object` sometimes already reports "Gaia DR3 <source_id>" directly for
pepsi (observed) — parsed straight into gaia_source_id when it
matches that pattern, skipping SIMBAD entirely for those (guaranteed-
accurate, no round trip needed). Applied uniformly to mods/luci too
(cheap, harmless if it never matches there). Everything else (IRAS/TIC/
TOI designations, etc.) goes through as raw_target_name for the normal
SIMBAD-then-position fallback. ra/dec are always populated when parseable
regardless — kept as the raw-position audit trail same as every other
archive, not just for records that fall through to positional matching.

No paging cliff found for mods/luci (observed: 20,000 rows in
~1.7-1.8s for both) — kept at the same PAGE_SIZE as pepsi for consistency
rather than tuned up, since pepsi's own cliff was never characterized
either (no cliff found there, just never pushed further than 5,000).

Cursor shape changed from a single flat {"last_date_obs": ...} (pepsi
only) to {instrument: {"last_date_obs": ...}, ...} (many). Reads a
pre-existing flat pepsi-only cursor as a fallback for the "PEPSI" key
specifically, so a production cursor written before this change doesn't
silently restart pepsi from scratch.

fetch() queries every instrument once per call rather than converging one
at a time — same pattern as sync/archives/noirlab.py's and
sync/archives/koa.py's multi-instrument fetch.
