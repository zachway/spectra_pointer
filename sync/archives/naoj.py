"""NAOJ / Subaru HDS, via JVO (Japanese Virtual Observatory) — TAP.

Not the SMOKA archive (the prior investigation's dead end still holds for
SMOKA specifically: registration-gated web wizard, no bulk API). This is a
completely separate TAP+SSA service run by JVO (jvo.nao.ac.jp) for Subaru's
High Dispersion Spectrograph, found via the reg.g-vo.org registry sweep.
Checked the registry for other Subaru instruments
(FOCAS, IRCS, Suprime-Cam, MOIRCS): only HDS has a registered spectroscopy
TAP/SSA capability, the rest are imaging-only (SIA).

This is a custom JVOQL engine, not DaCHS/PostgreSQL like every other TAP
archive in this project — several real quirks follow from that:

- `SELECT *` is unusable: it declares `access_estsize` as VOTable datatype
  "int" but actually emits decimal strings like "849.9200000000000000" for
  some rows, which astropy's VOTable parser rejects outright
  (DALFormatError). Fix is simply to not select that column — every
  column actually needed here (position, time, name, URL) parses fine.
- No `instrument_name` column at all — this table is HDS-only by
  construction, so instrument is hardcoded below rather than read.
- `obs_publisher_did` is not a per-row identifier here (observed: the
  same literal 'ivo://jvo/subaru/hds/spec' on every row) — the real per-
  observation key is `raw_id` (e.g. "HDSA00027401").
- `COUNT(DISTINCT raw_id)` silently ignores DISTINCT and returns the same
  value as COUNT(*) (observed) — this engine doesn't seem to support
  it at all, so don't rely on DISTINCT anywhere in this module.
- Server-side row cap of 200,000 regardless of TOP/maxrec requested
  (observed via the RECORD_MAX info element) — irrelevant at this
  module's PAGE_SIZE, just don't assume a single unpaginated pull can ever
  see the whole table (253,389 rows total).

Row multiplicity: most raw_ids appear multiple times, not as duplicates but
as different pipeline products of the same single exposure — one raw_id
was observed with 6 rows sharing an identical target/time/position: three
`application/fits` variants (raw/wavelength-corrected/1D-extracted,
distinguished only by filename infix) plus matching `text/plain` dumps of
each. `_product_rank` below picks the single best row per raw_id per page:
the fully-processed 1D fits product first, less-processed fits next, then
any other fits, then a packaged tar (older pre-pipeline observations, ~1,600
raw_ids have no fits row at all and only ship as one .tar), then text/plain
last. Dedup is per-page (grouped by raw_id within whatever one `fetch` call
pulls back) rather than global — a raw_id whose rows happen to straddle a
page boundary could in principle pick a slightly worse product than the
true best, but ties in `t_mid` (the pagination watermark) are tight (at most
~6 rows) relative to PAGE_SIZE, so this is a rare cosmetic edge case, not a
correctness one.

date_obs is already a plain ISO date string — parsed directly rather than
converting t_mid (MJD) through astropy, which would just reproduce the same
day with extra steps. obs_title packs the target name and wavelength range
together as "NAME [lo:hi]" (observed, format-consistent across a
200,000-row sample, e.g. "Arcturus [657.49:778.01]"; a handful of BIAS
calibration frames slip through under the same shape too, resolved to "BIAS"
as raw_target_name — same as SIMBAD-unresolvable names elsewhere in this
project, naturally skipped by the generic discover_stars step) — the name is
everything before " [".

No native Gaia column, no cliff found in ORDER BY t_mid pagination up to
50,000 rows/page (1.3-4.7s) — standard TOP+watermark, same shape as
dao.py/mast.py.
