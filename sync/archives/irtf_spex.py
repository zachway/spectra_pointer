"""IRTF/SpeX (NASA Infrared Telescope Facility) — IRSA-hosted CAOM2 TAP.

The user's tip that this archive "is split into a few different databases"
is observed, and matters for scope: IRTF's public holdings are spread
across at least four independent systems --

1. IRTF Legacy Archive (irtfdata.ifa.hawaii.edu) -- 2000B-2016A semesters,
   pure HTML directory browsing + a web search form, no API found.
2. This module's source: the IRSA-hosted IRTF Data Archive
   (irsa.ipac.caltech.edu) -- 2016B-present (SpeX from 2016-08-02 onward,
   observed), the only piece with a real machine-readable API (IBE +
   TAP, both mirroring the same underlying CAOM2 tables). Covers both of
   IRTF's current instruments, SpeX (here) and iSHELL (irtf_ishell.py) --
   see sync/archives/_irtf_common.py for the shared fetch logic.
3. irtf.mearth_spectra -- a separate, unrelated IRSA table ("IRTF MEarth
   Spectra") sitting right next to the CAOM ones in the same IBE mission
   listing; a genuinely different dataset, not covered by this module.
4. The IRTF Spectral Library (irtfweb.ifa.hawaii.edu/~spex/IRTF_Spectral_Library/)
   -- a curated, static reference library of ~2000 published stellar/
   substellar spectra, not an observation-log archive with a query API.

This module only covers #2, which is also the only one with new data still
arriving. Observed via IRSA's TAP_SCHEMA that the CAOM2 model here is
split the same way as CADC's (see dao.py/cfht_cadc.py): caom.observation_irtf
(instrument/target/proposal) joined to caom.plane_irtf (calibration level,
time bounds) via obsid, plus caom.artifact_irtf (actual file URIs) via
planeid -- IRSA's IBE-listed "irtf_tables" page only advertises the plane
table, but the observation/artifact tables exist and are queryable directly
once you know the CADC-style naming convention.

NO POSITION DATA AT ALL for SpeX, observed: every one of 86,511
SpeX planes has a NULL observation.targetposition_coordinates (checked with
a live COUNT), and the plane table itself carries no s_ra/s_dec-equivalent
columns either (only internal spatial index descriptors). Name-only
matching, same shape as lick.py -- ra/dec left None throughout, matcher
falls through straight to name_resolved and silently skips anything that
doesn't hit a tracked alias (see sync/matcher.py's third path).

target_name needs light cleanup before it's usable as an identifier,
observed against real recent rows: catalog names come through
underscore-joined ("HD_218251", "SAO_74912", "TIC_404752671") -- matcher's
_normalize_name already strips whitespace before comparing, so converting
"_" to " " is enough to line these up with SIMBAD-style aliases. Some also
carry an appended reddening estimate ("HD_176542_AV=+1.16", observed
on ~750 of 86,511 rows) that must be stripped first or the name never
matches anything. No filtering of non-stellar rows (target_name=="calibration",
~16,847 rows; minor planet designations like "623 Chimaera (A907 BC)";
Landolt standard fields like "SA 93-101") -- none of these will ever match a
tracked star's alias list, so they fall through to a harmless skip exactly
like any bulk archive's non-target rows elsewhere in this project.

calibrationlevel is 1 (raw) on every single SpeX row, observed (no
row at any other level) -- this IRSA mirror only carries IRTF's raw output,
there's no separate reduced-product tier to pick between (unlike
gemini_igrins.py's GOA gap). reduction_status_from_calib_level still used
for consistency/future-proofing rather than hardcoding "raw", in case IRSA
ever ingests a calibrated tier.

archive_url points at each plane's real summary.html landing page (e.g.
".../summary/2022B013/sbd_20220802_060505/summary.html"), pulled directly
from caom.artifact_irtf (producttype='info', contenttype='text/html') --
observed to exist as exactly one such row per plane (a plain page a
human can open, listing the observation's raw frames/weather/QA), not a
raw signed-nothing FITS link. Deliberately not the science FITS artifacts
themselves: each plane bundles many of those per sequence (flats, arcs, and
the actual target frames all as separate 'science'-producttype artifacts,
observed -- e.g. 8 raw frames under one plane), so there's no single
canonical file to point at the way DataLink resolvers give CADC-based
archives one.

Paginated via a plain MJD watermark on plane.time_bounds_lower, same shape
as dao.py. PAGE_SIZE=5000 chosen generously under volume (86,511 total
rows observed) with no sign of a cliff -- a 20,000-row version of
this exact join query ran in under 5s live.
