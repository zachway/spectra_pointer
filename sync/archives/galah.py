"""GALAH DR4 — DataCentral TAP, direct Gaia DR3 source_id column.

galah_dr4.mainspectable carries essentially 100% Gaia DR3 coverage (verified:
1,085,520 / 1,085,520 rows non-null), so no positional fallback is needed —
any null gaiadr3_source_id is just skipped defensively.

Incremental via an mjd watermark: GALAH DR4 is itself a fixed release (not a
live-growing table), so this mostly matters for re-runs after a future DR.

reduction_status is hardcoded 'reduced' -- mainspectable's slink deep link
serves GALAH's pipeline-reduced, continuum-normalized, wavelength-
calibrated 1D spectrum (the standard DR4 public product), never a raw CCD
frame; GALAH has no public raw-frame distribution path.
