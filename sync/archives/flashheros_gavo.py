"""Flash/Heros Public Spectra (GAVO Heidelberg) — TAP, no positions, name-only match.

Same GAVO Heidelberg DaCHS/SSA hosting as feros_gavo.py, found via the same
reg.g-vo.org registry — a different, unrelated instrument (Flash and
Heros are two echelle spectrographs run together on La Silla in the late
1990s bright-star survey era, not affiliated with ESO's FEROS). 14,573
real spectra (application/fits rows), real bright-star target
names (e.g. "68 Cyg"). Final, static dataset — one full pull is enough
forever, same shape as rave.py/feros_gavo.py.

flashheros.data has no populated position at all on every row sampled (both
the plain ra/dec columns and ssa_targetpos come back empty) — same as
feros_gavo.py, so every record here can only ever go through the matcher's
name_resolved path.

Same paired-row shape as feros_gavo.py too: each real spectrum has a
sibling application/x-votable+xml metadata-only row (observed: exactly
2x count) — filtered via mime rather than deduping client-side.

Unlike feros.data, flashheros.data has no ssa_instrument *column* — it's a
per-service constant (always "Flash/Heros"), exposed only as a VOTable INFO
comment rather than a per-row field (observed: selecting it raises
"No such field known"), so it's hardcoded here instead of read from a row.

ssa_dateObs is masked on 36 of 14,573 rows (observed) — a bare
Time(float(masked_value), ...) crashes with "Input values for mjd class
must be finite doubles" rather than silently producing NaT, so those rows
go in with obs_date=None instead.
