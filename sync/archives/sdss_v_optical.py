"""SDSS-V Optical (BOSS, current era) — bulk spAll-lite FITS file.

https://data.sdss.org/sas/dr20/spectro/boss/redux/v6_2_1/summary/daily/spAll-lite-v6_2_1.fits.gz

Turned out downloadable after all — DR20 ships this as ~2.5GB gzip-compressed
(unlike the DESI MWS VAC file, gzip isn't seekable, so unlike desi.py this
can't use HTTP Range windows; the whole file has to be fetched and
decompressed to read any of it). Live-verified: the SPALL table's GAIA_ID
column is a first-party Gaia join, 100% populated among CLASS='STAR' rows in
the DR19 v6_1_3 sample pulled here — the earlier CAS SQL-only investigation
just hadn't found the bulk file's column exposed anywhere queryable.

First cut of this re-downloaded the full file on every fetch() call (into
a tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() that deletes itself when the call returns)
-- since this archive isn't paginated (one fetch() returns every new row in
a single pass, so sync.main only calls it twice per run: once to get
everything new, once to confirm zero), that meant downloading the whole
file twice per sync run. Caches it in a persistent local path instead, so
the second (confirming, always-empty) call is a local re-read rather than
another multi-GB fetch. The cache is deleted once that empty confirmation
happens, so it's temporary scratch space, not a permanent fixture -- same
pattern as desi.py's row-window cache.

DR20 (live-verified 2026-07-31 against the real FITS header, TTYPE36
comment): GAIA_ID has switched from "Gaia DR2 SourceID" to "Gaia DR3
SourceID" as expected -- see the sdss-gaia-id-dr20-transition project
memory. No reconciliation needed for rows pulled via this DR20 URL.

DR20 also reorganized the reduction pipeline layout, both live-verified:
reduction version is v6_2_1 (was v6_1_3 for DR19), and the summary/spectra
trees now split into daily/epoch/allepoch flavors -- "daily" (used here) is
the one-row-per-visit flavor matching this project's per-observation model
(the other two are coadds, like apStar, with no single obs_date). The
per-observation spectrum path also gained a field-prefix grouping directory
level not present in DR19 (e.g. field 015002 lives under 015XXX/015002/...,
grouping by the field number's first 3 of 6 zero-padded digits) -- computed
in fetch() below.

SPEC_FILE gives the exact per-observation filename directly (no need to
reconstruct it) — observed against the real SAS directory listing.

reduction_status is hardcoded 'reduced' -- spAll-lite is the pipeline-
reduced, flux/wavelength-calibrated per-visit spectrum (the whole point of
the "reduction version" v6_2_1 tag above), never a raw CCD frame; SDSS has
no public raw-frame distribution path at all.
