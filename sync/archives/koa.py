"""Keck Observatory Archive — TAP, no native Gaia column.

TAP endpoint: https://koa.ipac.caltech.edu/TAP, schema koa_tap, one table per
instrument (koa_hires, koa_deimos, koa_lris, ...) — found directly from
KOA's own PyKOA docs.

Originally scoped to koa_hires alone; extended to koa_deimos, koa_esi,
koa_lris, koa_nires, and then again to koa_nirspec, koa_kpf, koa_mosfire,
koa_osiris (this pass added after 18 Sco/HR 6060 was found to have only
~21 matched HIRES holdings tracked, when KOA's own web search reports
1,136 science files for that position across four instruments;
NIRSPEC alone — used there as a near-IR telluric standard under object
names like "BS6060"/"HD 146233" — accounts for 683 of those). Per
TAP_SCHEMA's column listing, koa_deimos/koa_esi carry both `mjd`
and `mjd_obs` (same shape as koa_hires), as does koa_nirspec (`mjd` only,
no `mjd_obs`), while koa_lris/koa_nires/koa_kpf/koa_mosfire/koa_osiris
carry only `mjd_obs` — no `mjd` column at all, per this module's own
earlier note. INSTRUMENTS below records the right column per table instead
of assuming a uniform schema.

Evaluated and not added:
- koa_kcwi: technically a spectrograph (IFU), but real object names skew
  overwhelmingly extragalactic/quasar-sightline (e.g. "Q0142_BX195",
  "SDSS2151+0921") — only ~1.8% of object-frame rows match a star-catalog
  naming pattern (HD/HR/GJ/BD/HIP/TYC), against ~6-13% for
  koa_mosfire/koa_osiris (kept in despite also being extragalactic-heavy,
  since their absolute stellar-named counts are in the thousands). "Cosmic
  Web Imager" is a fair description of what it's actually pointed at.
- koa_nirc, koa_nirc2, koa_guider: imaging cameras / acquisition, not
  spectrographs (NIRC2 has a rarely-used grism mode but is overwhelmingly
  an AO imager).
- koa_lws: decommissioned mid-IR spectrometer with no `object` column at
  all in its TAP table — no target name to match against.
- koa_reduced_data: a processed-products table spanning every instrument,
  different shape entirely (not a per-instrument raw-observation table);
  out of scope for this pass.

A previously-flagged "ORDER BY + TOP returns unsorted results" bug could
not be reproduced — 200 rows tested, strictly
non-decreasing mjd throughout. Standard TOP+ORDER BY+watermark pagination
used here; if the old bug resurfaces in practice, fall back to WHERE-range
chunking like eso.py instead.

koaimtyp='object' does not reliably exclude calibration frames (several
returned rows had object='flat') — same tradeoff as CFHT/CADC
and Gemini, left unfiltered rather than chasing a cleaner filter; harmless
rows just get skipped by the matcher.

Deep link observed: filehand (e.g.
"/koadata14/HIRES/20170924/lev0/HI.20170924.17613.fits") through
cgi-bin/getKOA/nph-getKOA?filehand=... resolves to real FITS bytes (despite
a misleading text/html content-type header). Same resolver works for every
instrument here (path prefix changes, cgi endpoint doesn't).

Cursor shape changed from a single flat {"last_mjd": ...} (HIRES only) to
{instrument: {"last_mjd": ...}, ...} (many). Reads a pre-existing flat
HIRES-only cursor as a fallback for the "HIRES" key specifically, so a
production cursor written before this change doesn't silently restart
HIRES from mjd 0 (UNIQUE (archive_code, archive_obs_id) would make that
harmless, just wasteful — this avoids the waste).

fetch() queries every instrument once per call rather than converging one
at a time — sync.main's driver only stops once a whole page returns zero
records, so an instrument that's already caught up just contributes an
empty result on each subsequent call until every instrument is caught up
together, same pattern as sync/archives/noirlab.py's multi-instrument fetch.
