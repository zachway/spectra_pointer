"""GTC (Gran Telescopio CANARIAS) Public Archive -- HTML form POST, no TAP/API.

Same CAB/INTA JSP application family as carmenes_caha.py
(gtc.sdc.cab.inta-csic.es vs caha.sdc.cab.inta-csic.es), but this archive
was previously written off as a dead end: a bare GET on `searchform.jsp`
reproducibly 500s. That 500 turned out to be the JSP app rejecting
requests with no session cookie and no browser-like User-Agent/Accept
headers -- confirmed live, twice, with a fresh unauthenticated session:
hitting `/gtc/` first to pick up a JSESSIONID and sending a real
User-Agent made `searchform.jsp` return 200 every time. Once past that,
the actual search (`searchres.jsp`, POST multipart/form-data) turned out
to need *no* session/cookie at all -- a completely stateless one-shot POST
with every filter field set returns real results (confirmed live,
719,927+ products for a full-history spectroscopy-only query). The
"500 even with a session cookie" conclusion in the earlier investigation
was itself a User-Agent/Accept-header issue, not a real server bug.

No registry/API shortcut exists either: reg.g-vo.org lists a SIAP
(imaging) service at /gtc/siap/{gtc,osiris}_siap.jsp, real and live, but
SIAP is image-only and disjoint from the spectroscopy modes covered here.

instCode restricts the query server-side to spectroscopy-only observing
modes: OSI_LSS/OSI_MOS (OSIRIS Long Slit / Multi-Object Spectroscopy),
MEG_SPE/MEG_IFU (MEGARA MOS / IFU), HORuS_SPE, CC_SPE (CanariCam
spectroscopy), EMIR_SPE -- excludes every imaging/polarimetry/tunable-
filter mode the same form also offers (confirmed real server-side
filtering, not a client-side illusion). No further calibration-frame
filter is applied -- a sample of 3,000 recent rows showed no BIAS/ARC/FLAT-
style object names, unlike koa.py/lbt.py's archives; whatever engineering
frames do exist should simply fail to resolve downstream, same reasoning
lick.py/ing.py give for their own unfiltered free-text object names.

Each row's Program ID + OBlock ID + numeric ProdId (e.g.
"GTC78-19B..0007..2809328") is the archive's own composite key for
`FetchProd`, its direct per-exposure raw-FITS download servlet -- confirmed
live to serve a real ungated FITS.gz (200 OK, ~11MB, no login) for public
data. Public rows carry this link directly in the HTML; embargoed rows
collapse everything past the "Pub" column into one
"Private Data. They will become public on: <date>" cell with no link at
all -- but Program ID/OBlock ID/ProdId are still visible before that
collapse, so the same composite URL is built by hand for those rows too
(same convention as salt_hrs.py: the URL will 403/redirect until the
listed release date passes, harmless since nothing here downloads bytes).
GTC's own front page states data become public after a 1-year proprietary
period.

Pagination: rpp (results per page) is a plain form field, not capped to
the dropdown's advertised 10/50/100 -- passing an arbitrary larger value
works (confirmed live: rpp=3000 returns exactly 3000 rows in ~18s,
rpp=5000 in ~46s), but there's a real cliff beyond that (rpp=10000 didn't
finish in 90s, confirmed live twice) -- capped well under it here. Bigger
problem: a *fixed* full-history query is default-ordered newest-first
(order_by=0, Observing Date) with no ascending option, and the archive is
live -- its own "N products found" count changed by hundreds between two
back-to-back requests during investigation. A page-number/frontier cursor
like carmenes_caha.py's would silently miss everything new (new rows land
at page 1, and a frontier cursor only ever advances to *later*, i.e.
older, pages). Paginates instead as an adaptive calendar-window walk on
the dateinit/dateend fields, same shape as ing.py: request one page per
window at a size well under the rpp cliff, and if the returned count hits
that cap (a real page is likely truncated), bisect the window and retry;
grow the window back up after an unsaturated page. This walks strictly
forward through the fixed [FIRST_DATE, today-at-window-open] history
regardless of how new inserts reorder later pages, so nothing at the
growing edge is ever skipped.
