"""Las Cumbres Observatory / FLOYDS spectrograph — public Science Archive REST API.

See sync/archives/_lco_common.py for the shared fetch/grouping/pagination
logic and its full live-investigation writeup. FLOYDS-specific facts:
low-res long-slit, one unit per 2m site (en06/en12), fully identified by
OBSTYPE=SPECTRUM (observed: every one of 52,038 public spectrum
frames is en-coded). Position availability depends on which reduction
tier ends up representing a given observation, not fixed per-instrument —
see _lco_common's docstring.
