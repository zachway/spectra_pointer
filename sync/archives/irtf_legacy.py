"""IRTF Legacy Archive (irtfdata.ifa.hawaii.edu) — pre-2016B, plain HTML GET form.

The third of the four independent IRTF systems identified in irtf_spex.py's
docstring — this one covers 2000B-2016A, before IRTF's holdings moved to
IRSA (irtf_spex.py/irtf_ishell.py, 2016B-present). Originally written off
after only checking the homepage/directory-browser page (real, but pure
HTML directory browsing with no per-observation metadata). Checked again,
directly, per this project's own "verify archive access directly"
precedent — the *other* nav link, /search/, is a real, unauthenticated
GET form (`results.php?Semester=&StartUTCDate=...&EndUTCDate=...&
ProgramID=&Instrument=...`) returning a structured HTML table with real
per-frame ra/dec, target name, instrument, program ID, and a direct file
path — observed, not a directory listing at all.

END_DATE is a hard boundary at 2016-08-01 (exclusive) — irtf_spex.py's IRSA
coverage observed to begin 2016-08-02 (semester 2016B). Without this
cap, the same physical observations from the 2016B transition would risk
appearing under two different archive_code values (this module and
irtf_spex/irtf_ishell) — not a database-level duplicate (archive_code
differs, so the UNIQUE constraint allows it) but a real logical one a user
would see twice in one star's holdings. This module simply never queries
past the boundary, no dedup needed.

Three instrument codes covered, observed via a real 5000-row sample's
own instrument breakdown: sbd_1 (SpeX/"bigdog" v1, 2000-2014) and sbd_2
(SpeX v2, 2014-2016A) are this era's SpeX — walked as two sequential
phases since they're already time-disjoint by the archive's own design,
no need to guess the exact cutover date. cshell (CSHELL, IRTF's other
retired NIR high-res spectrograph, 2000-2016B) turned out to have real,
substantial volume in that same sample (1,190 of 5,000 rows) — added as a
third phase rather than left out, since it's the same table/access
pattern at zero extra cost once the walk itself works. mirsi_1 ("2-20um
camera and grism spectrograph") was also present in that sample but
deliberately excluded — dual imaging/spectroscopy mode with no mode/grism
column in the results table to tell which is which for a given frame,
same reasoning noirlab.py/ing.py give for excluding their own dual-mode
instruments without a clean discriminator. sgd_1/sgd_2 (SpeX's imager/
guider channel, not the spectrograph) and the plain imagers (nsfcam*,
moris*) are never queried at all.

Row granularity is per-raw-FITS-file, not per-sequence (observed:
a single object's one science exposure comes with its own arc/flat
calibration frames as separate rows, object name "Argon lamp"/"Inc lamp"
on those) — no plane/block id exists anywhere in this table to group on
the way _lco_common.py/_irtf_common.py's modern sources do. No hand-
filtering of calibration rows attempted: same reasoning as lick.py/ing.py
give for their own free-text-label archives — "Argon lamp" et al. simply
never match a tracked star's alias list and fall through to a harmless
skip, while a bespoke label-matching filter would inevitably miss some
real variant and risk dropping genuine science rows instead. A handful of
rows carry an obvious placeholder object name ("object name") and blank
ra/dec (observed, e.g. a stray *_noise_test-*.fits engineering
frame) — left in for the same reason, harmless.

ra/dec are real sexagesimal strings on real frames, blank on some
(observed) — parsed the same way as ing.py's own sexagesimal
columns, blank treated as no-position rather than erroring.

Pagination: the form's own page states a 5000-row cap ("Maximum number of
search results returned is 5000"), observed (a one-year, all-
instrument query came back with exactly "Found 5000 records" against an
internal "all rows:5005" comment -- the comment isn't parsed, just the
round-number cap is treated as the truncation signal). Walked as an
adaptive UTC-date-window crawl exactly like ing.py's own (bisect the
window on truncation, grow it back up after a clean page) -- the same
"coverage density varies hugely across a multi-decade archive" reasoning
applies here too, not re-derived independently.
