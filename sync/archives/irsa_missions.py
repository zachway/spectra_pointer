"""IRSA space-mission stellar collections — SSA.

Six independent, historical space-mission (or airborne-mission) stellar
spectral collections behind IRSA's one shared SSA service
(irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/SSA?COLLECTION=...), same one-archive-many-
instruments shape as oirsa.py/svo_cab.py. All six observed,
2026-08-07, and share one uniform CAOM-derived SSA column schema (unlike
svo_cab.py's five independently-configured services) -- s_ra/s_dec,
target_name, tmid (MJD), access_url, access_format, calib_level, and
curation_publisherdid are the same column across every collection here.

  - spitzer_sass     -- Spitzer Atlas of Stellar Spectra: 159 stars.
  - spitzer_irs_std  -- Spitzer IRS Standard Stars: 73 stars.
  - iso_sws          -- ISO/SWS.
  - iras_lrs         -- IRAS/LRS Atlas.
  - sofia_exes       -- SOFIA/EXES: 2,580 distinct observations across
    29,212 raw per-order/per-nod FITS files -- ended 2022 (SOFIA retired),
    fully archived, still the single largest collection bundled here.
  - irtf_mearth      -- "Near-Infrared Metallicities, Radial Velocities and
    Spectral Types for 447 Nearby M Dwarfs" (Newton et al. 2014), a
    standalone IRSA table (irtf.mearth_spectra) genuinely separate from the
    IRTF CAOM2 TAP holdings already covered by irtf_spex.py/irtf_ishell.py/
    irtf_legacy.py -- flagged as a known gap in irtf_spex.py's own
    docstring, closed here. 468 stars, 498 spectra.

Deliberately excludes every other Spitzer IRSA collection found alongside
these (spitzer_sings, spitzer_m83m33, spitzer_c2d, spitzer_sage,
spitzer_s5, spitzer_5muses, spitzer_ssgss) -- confirmed extragalactic/ISM
surveys, not stellar, out of scope.

SIZE is a real radius here too, same confirmed-live behavior as svo_cab.py
(not the usual IVOA SSA "diameter" reading): querying irtf_mearth from two
opposite points on the sky (POS=0,90 and POS=180,0) at SIZE=180, and again
at SIZE=360, all returned the identical 498-row result -- consistent only
with SIZE=180 already covering the whole sky, not one hemisphere. Four of
the six collections stay comfortably fast at that whole-sky SIZE=180 despite
their real volume (observed: spitzer_sass 4.7s, spitzer_irs_std 4.4s,
irtf_mearth ~10s, sofia_exes ~20-48s across repeat queries) -- pulled in a
single page each, no pagination needed (see WHOLE_SKY_COLLECTIONS).

iso_sws and iras_lrs are the two exceptions: SIZE=180 hard-times-out
server-side for both ("QUERY_STATUS=ERROR: TransientFault: INTERNAL_SERVER_
ERROR: Job ran but timed out", observed, reproduced twice each) even
though a 2-degree box near Orion only turns up 44/10 real hits -- these two
collections' underlying tables appear to lack a working spatial index (query
latency scales roughly linearly with SIZE, not with area or hit count:
SIZE=20 ~16-18s, SIZE=30 ~27s, SIZE=45 ~48-49s, SIZE=55 already exceeds 75s,
observed for both). SIZE=45 is the largest cell size confirmed to
reliably return within IRSA's apparent timeout window, so these two are
paginated instead via a justified sky-grid crawl (small, historical,
already-closed mission archives -- not a full-sky survey a grid crawl
wouldn't scale to): a fixed 17-cell grid (GRID_CELLS, ~50-degree spacing,
cos(dec)-scaled RA step count) with generous SIZE=45 overlap per cell.
fetch() processes exactly one (collection, cell) pair per call -- same
one-window-per-call shape as ing.py's date-window crawl -- converging after
34 calls (17 cells x 2 collections) plus one final empty call, rather than
one page per collection.

Each real observation is served across 2-3 parallel access_format rows
(a preview image/gif or image/png thumbnail alongside the real science
product) -- filtered per collection to the one real data format (see
WHOLE_SKY_COLLECTIONS/GRID_COLLECTIONS' "format" key), observed per
collection (e.g. spitzer_sass: image/gif + application/fits + text/plain,
159 each; sofia_exes: image/fits + image/png, not evenly split since EXES
emits several raw order/nod files per real observation under one shared
PublisherDID). archive_obs_id is the row's own access_url rather than
curation_publisherdid for exactly that reason -- PublisherDID groups
multiple real distinct files together for sofia_exes, but access_url is
guaranteed unique per real file across every collection here.

target_name is populated directly for iso_sws/sofia_exes/irtf_mearth
(underscore-joined on iso_sws, e.g. "HR4534_BET-LEO" -- cleaned the same
way irtf_spex.py cleans its own underscore-joined names) but is an empty
string on every spitzer_sass/spitzer_irs_std/iras_lrs row (observed)
-- for those three, the name is recovered instead from the tail of
curation_publisherdid (e.g. "ivo://irsa.ipac/spitzer_irs_std/HD 127693" ->
"HD 127693"; "ivo://irsa.ipac/iras_lrs/11210+1707" -> "11210+1707", a real
IRAS Point Source Catalog designation, not a star name -- falls through to
a harmless skip downstream like any other unresolvable identifier).

tmid (MJD) is real and populated on every sofia_exes/irtf_mearth row
(observed, 0 masked in both) but fully masked on every spitzer_sass/
spitzer_irs_std/iso_sws/iras_lrs row observed -- those four are
static, already-fully-reprocessed atlas products with no preserved
per-observation epoch in this table (dataid_date is populated instead, but
that is observed to be a data-*processing*/ingestion timestamp, e.g.
iras_lrs's dataid_date is uniformly "2025-06-04" across every row --
decades after the 1983 IRAS mission -- not a real observation date, so
deliberately not used as a stand-in). obs_date is left None for those four,
same "no real per-observation date" shape as several of svo_cab.py's five
libraries.

calib_level is real and present on every row across all six collections
(observed) -- fed through reduction_status_from_calib_level as usual;
sofia_exes in particular has a genuine mix (2/1/masked observed live),
unlike the other five which are uniformly a single value.
