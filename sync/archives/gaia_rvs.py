"""Gaia RVS — radial-velocity spectra, native Gaia TAP, source_id-watermark
pagination.

Independent discovery archive, not a walk over stars this project already
tracks: queries gaiadr3.gaia_source directly via Gaia's own TAP service for
every source with has_rvs='true'. Observed (2026-08-04) that
`SELECT COUNT(*) ... WHERE has_rvs = 'true'` returns exactly 999,645 — the
same figure published at https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/dr3 as the DR3
mean-RVS-spectra release total. discover_stars registers any source_id not
already tracked via some other archive, the same as any other archive's
direct_gaia_column records.

Filtering has_rvs='true' before the ORDER BY/TOP keeps this fast
(50,000-row page in ~5s) even though gaiadr3.gaia_source itself is
~1.8B rows — this isn't the unbounded-ORDER-BY cliff that bit mast_jwst.py,
because the qualifying set is ~1M rows, not the full table.

Paginated by a source_id watermark rather than by date/mjd: DR3 is a single
fixed release (not a live-growing feed), and source_id is a unique integer
under ORDER BY, so (unlike a t_min/mjd watermark shared by many rows at a
page boundary, see eso.py) a plain max-seen-value watermark can't skip or
duplicate rows at the boundary.

Old cursor shape from before this was a real archive module (an
after_star_id watermark over this project's own `stars` table) is silently
ignored by cursor.get's default here — the first run under this module
starts over from source_id 0 and re-walks the full ~1M RVS sources. That's
intentional: this project only had 734,664 of them tracked before (only
those also seen by some other archive), so a full re-walk is needed to pick
up the remaining ~265k RVS stars this project never had a reason to track
before. Already-tracked stars are cheap to re-see — add_stars_batch skips
the Gaia round trip for any gaia_source_id already in `stars`, and the
matcher's ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING makes re-matching an already-held spectrum
a no-op.
