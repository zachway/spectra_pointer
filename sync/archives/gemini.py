"""Gemini via CADC — same TAP infrastructure as cfht_cadc.py, different cliff.

CADC hosts Gemini data too (obs_collection 'GEMINI', plus a tiny 'GEMINICADC'
subset — both included). No native Gaia column — positional match.

A sharp cliff, worse than CFHT's: `ORDER BY t_min` makes even
a 1,000-row query take 72.7s, regardless of page size (10,000 rows timed out
past 90s). Without ORDER BY, the same filters return in 1-4s. So this can't
paginate via TOP+ORDER BY+watermark like eso.py/cfht_cadc.py — instead it
chunks by a fixed 7-day date window (no sort needed at all), the same
approach Gemini's own native REST API required (weekly chunking,
~260 sci-spectra/week). Watermark is the window start, advancing
7 days per call regardless of row count.

t_min=0.0 is a real sentinel for missing dates (not just theoretical) —
filtered out. Real Gemini spectrum data starts at MJD 51946.48 (2001-01-24,
MIN(t_min) WHERE t_min > 0) — used as the default cursor
start to avoid iterating empty weeks back to MJD 0.

sync.main's generic driver stops calling fetch() the first time it gets 0
records back, on the assumption that an empty page means the archive is
exhausted -- true for every other archive here (they all filter on
field > watermark, open-ended to "now"), but false for a fixed window:
an empty week says nothing about whether week 500 has data. This bites
almost immediately -- the very first real week (starting
51946.0) has 9 records, the second (51953.0) has 0, so the generic driver
stopped after 2 pages, having covered 2 weeks of a ~25-year archive.
Fixed by looping internally past empty windows here, so a single fetch()
call only returns empty when window_start has genuinely caught up to
the present -- keeping the generic driver's "stop on empty" logic valid.

Deep link: same DataLink resolver as CFHT, observed on a real Gemini
record (GNIRS spectrum, direct FITS file resolved and downloadable).

s_ra/s_dec read via clean_float — can be masked on real rows (confirmed as a
real pattern via mast.py), and a bare float() would turn that into NaN and
crash the matcher's KD-tree build outright.
