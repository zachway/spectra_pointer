"""SDSS Legacy Optical (BOSS/eBOSS, pre-SDSS-V) — DR20 bulk "allspec" catalog.

https://data.sdss.org/sas/dr20/spectro/allspec/1.0.2/allspec-dr20-1.0.2.fits.gz

DR20 update (2026-07-31): file grew from DR19's 812MB/14.6M rows to
1.44GB/27.7M rows (new SDSS-V FPS-era data), live-verified via a partial
range-fetch of the gzip header to still expose the same column set this
module reads (instrument/mjd/specobjid/run2d/ra/dec/cas_url, same names).
The legacy subset this module actually extracts (instrument='boss', mjd in
[FIRST_MJD, LEGACY_MJD_CUTOFF)) is historical and out of SDSS-V's FPS-era
reduction path, so it isn't expected to change release over release --
just re-point the URL and let the module re-derive its cache fresh.

First cut of this used SkyServer's SqlSearch REST API, paginated 50,000 rows
at a time by an mjd watermark — observed to work for 18 consecutive
pages (~900K rows) before getting HTTP 403 Forbidden, the signature of
SkyServer's anti-bot/rate-limiting kicking in after sustained automated
querying (plain requests.get(), default User-Agent, no delay between
calls). Switched to DR19's unified "allspec" bulk catalog instead (812MB
compressed, 14.6M rows spanning every SDSS instrument/era) — observed
to cover 3.96M BOSS rows in the legacy MJD range (55176-58932) alone, 4x
what SkyServer had delivered before the block, via a single plain download
with no rate limit to hit at all.

No CLASS column here (unlike SkyServer's specObj, which the old version
filtered on CLASS='STAR' server-side) — observed via programname/
survey: BOSS/eBOSS's legacy programs (DEEP_QSO, ELG_NGC/SGC, RM, eFEDS,
XMMXLL, ...) are cosmology-survey target-selection tags, not a stellar
filter, so there's no clean way to isolate stars from this file alone.
Goes through positional_easy_match unfiltered instead (this archive never
had a Gaia column either way) and accepts the extra non-stellar candidate
volume — positional matching against tracked stars already discards
non-matches harmlessly, same class-less approach already used for eso.py.

Paginated by fixed 7-day MJD windows rather than row count — a row-count
page (e.g. "next 50,000 rows sorted by mjd") risks splitting a single
night's observing run across two pages, and re-querying with a plain
mjd > watermark bound would then silently skip the rest of that night's
rows on the next page (same boundary-cutting failure mode fixed for
noirlab.py, different cause). A date window can't split a group unless the
group itself spans the boundary, which a single night's mjd value can't.
Sized empirically against the real file: 7-day windows give a max of
~45,000 rows and a median of ~9,000 per nonzero window (537 total windows,
340 nonzero), in line with the ~50,000-row pages used elsewhere in this
codebase. Verified the windowing math directly against the real file:
every one of the 3,956,000 legacy rows falls into exactly one window, no
gaps or double-counts. Same "loop past empty windows internally" fix as
gemini.py, needed for the same reason (an empty window here doesn't mean
the legacy range is exhausted) — except the stopping point here is a known
fixed constant (LEGACY_MJD_CUTOFF) rather than a live "now".

Two-stage cache, not one -- this went through two failed designs first,
both observed:
  1. Caching the downloaded .fits.gz directly and re-opening it per page:
     astropy's fits.open() transparently gunzips a .fits.gz path on every
     call, so ~340 pages meant re-decompressing the full 812MB from scratch
     ~340 times. Killed a test run after 2+ minutes still on the first few
     pages.
  2. Decompressing once to a plain .fits file, but still filtering
     (instrument='boss' + mjd range) and boolean-indexing the full 14.6M
     x 36-column table fresh on every fetch() call: a single call still
     didn't return within 60s. numpy string ops (np.char.strip on 14.6M
     rows) and fancy-indexing a wide structured array are just too slow to
     redo hundreds of times, even from a local mmap'd file.
Fixed by distilling down to a *third*, much smaller local cache: the ~3.96M
legacy rows, narrowed to only the 6 columns actually used, written once as
Parquet (DuckDB, not astropy, handles this well). Every fetch() call after
that is a single DuckDB range query against a small Parquet file --
observed at a few hundred ms, even repeated ~340 times.

plate/fiberid/mjd/specobjid/run2d/ra/dec are all fully populated (no
zero/NaN sentinels) for the legacy (instrument='boss', mjd<58932) subset
-- plate here is allspec's real per-row plate column, a different, more
precise field than plate_or_fps_field (which collapses BOSS-plate and
SDSS-V-fps_field into one column and isn't precise enough to build a
file path from -- see the archive_url paragraph below).

reduction_status is hardcoded 'reduced' -- the allspec catalog (like every
SDSS spectro data product) is the pipeline-processed, flux/wavelength-
calibrated 1D spectrum, never a raw CCD frame; SDSS has no public raw-frame
distribution path at all.

archive_url previously pointed at cas_url, a SkyServer object-explorer
*page*, not a spectrum file -- fine as a human deep link but useless for a
viewer wanting the actual FITS. allspec also carries plate/fiberid columns
directly (not previously kept -- only the coarser plate_or_fps_field was),
confirmed live to be fully populated for the legacy subset alongside mjd/
run2d, which is everything needed to build a direct file URL without
decoding specobjid's bit-packed encoding by hand. DR20 splits legacy vs.
SDSS-V reductions across two separate top-level trees -- sdss_v_optical.py's
boss/redux/ is SDSS-V-only (confirmed live: boss/redux/v5_13_2 404s) --
legacy run2d values instead live under sdss/redux/{run2d}/spectra/lite/
{plate}/spec-{plate}-{mjd}-{fiberid:04d}.fits (plate unpadded, fiberid
zero-padded to 4 digits, no separate mjd subdirectory unlike the SDSS-V
tree) -- confirmed live via a real directory listing and a real fetched
file (data.sdss.org/.../sdss/redux/v5_13_2/spectra/lite/6413/
spec-6413-56336-0522.fits, 200 OK, 218,880 bytes), opened with astropy and
confirmed to carry the standard SDSS COADD extension shape (flux/loglam/
ivar/and_mask/or_mask/wdisp/sky/model), same as sdss_v_optical.py's format.
The Parquet cache filename changed (LEGACY_CACHE_PATH) since the column set
changed -- an old cache from before this fix wouldn't have plate/fiberid
and would break the new SELECT, so this intentionally orphans rather than
reuses it.
