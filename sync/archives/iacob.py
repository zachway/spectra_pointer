"""IACOB Spectroscopic Database (IAC, Spain) — SSA, whole-sky one-shot pull.

A curated database of massive OB-star spectra maintained by the Instituto
de Astrofisica de Canarias, drawing on Mercator/HERMES and NOT/FIES data
(both instruments already have their own primary archives in this project
-- hermes_mercator.py, not_fies.py where present -- but IACOB is a separate,
independently-discoverable curation of a subset of those same
observations, same "different door into overlapping holdings" situation
this project already accepts elsewhere; it isn't deduped against them).

No plain TAP endpoint exists on this host, unlike the GAVO DaCHS family
(feros_gavo.py/hermes_mercator.py): `ocan.iac.es:8080/tap`, `/iacob/tap`,
and the DaCHS `__system__/tap/run/tap` convention all 404 with a plain
Tomcat default page (observed), not a DaCHS instance at all -- this
is a bespoke JSP-based SSA service, so a TAP query shape was never on the
table here.

Real, working SSA endpoint: `ocan.iac.es:8080/iacob/jsp/ssap.jsp`. No sky
crawl needed to cover the whole archive -- observed that `POS=0,0`
with a large enough `SIZE` (cone-search radius in degrees) converges to a
fixed total regardless of center or further radius increase (74 rows at
SIZE=60, 1085 at 120, 1240 at 150, 1255 at 180 and every larger SIZE tried
up to 1000) -- 1255 is the genuine whole-archive row count, not a
response-size cutoff, and one `POS=0,0&SIZE=360` request returns it in a
single ~730KB response. `TIME` (the SSA-standard time-range filter) was
tried as a possible incremental-pagination axis but errors out
(`QUERY_STATUS=ERROR`) on this service -- not supported here, so there is
no server-side way to ask for only new records since a prior run.

Because of that, and because match_records/run_sync always report nonzero
counts for any nonempty record list (there's no "0 new" outcome for a
record that was already seen -- matched/skipped/needs_review are all
still >0), returning the same 1255 rows on every call would loop
sync.main's per-archive driver forever. This module instead does one full
pull and then no-ops via a `synced_at` cursor, the same static-dataset
shape as feros_gavo.py/elodie.py -- except those archives are genuinely
decommissioned instruments, while Mercator/NOT are still operating
telescopes, so this is a documented current limitation (no way to detect
or fetch IACOB's incremental growth from this SSA service, not a claim
that the archive itself is finished growing).

The SSA response is a real, standards-shaped VOTable, but with one
genuinely malformed field: `TIME` is declared `datatype="TIMESTAMP"`
(observed), which isn't a valid VOTable datatype at all (the IVOA
spec only defines char/int/float/double/boolean/etc) -- astropy's VOTable
parser (and so pyvo.dal.SSAService, which relies on it) rejects the whole
response outright with `E06: Unknown datatype 'TIMESTAMP'`. Parsed via a
plain regex TR/TD walk instead, same workaround shape as not_fies.py's/
ing.py's own malformed-markup parsing, rather than trying to coerce
astropy into accepting it.

Column order within each `<TR>` (observed, stable across repeated
identical queries) is exactly the service's declared FIELD order:
AssocID, AcRef, Format, Title, Location, TIME, mys_filename, TARGET,
SP_CLASS, EXPTIME, SNR, DATA_RELEASE, INSTR, RESOL, DOWNLOAD, AXES, UNITS,
DIMEQ, SCALEQ. `AssocID` is not used as the per-row key here -- it reads
like a plain 1..N row counter over that query's result set rather than a
stable per-spectrum identifier, so `mys_filename` (the real FITS filename,
e.g. "HD10205_20131216_212859_M_V85000.fits", observed unique
across all 1255 rows) is used for `archive_obs_id` instead. `AcRef` is a
real, working download URL once the CDATA wrapper and the extra pair of
literal double-quotes the service wraps around it are stripped (verified
via a GET: 200, `application/octet-stream`, a genuine FITS
file) -- note it 401s on a bare HEAD request, so don't use HEAD to
sanity-check it.

`Location` is a plain "ra,dec" degree pair (observed against the
VOTable's own `<COOSYS equinox="2000">` and `ucd="pos.eq"` on the field --
equatorial J2000, same convention as everywhere else in this project).
`TARGET` carries real catalog names (e.g. "HD10205", "HD36629" --
observed, real known OB stars). All 1255 rows have a populated
Location/TIME/TARGET/AcRef (observed, 0 blank across every one of
those four fields) -- no missing-field handling needed for the happy
path, though parsing still degrades to None rather than raising if a
field is ever empty.

Only two instruments appear in the live data: MERCATOR (362 rows, R
85,000 on every one) and NOT (893 rows, split across R 46,000/67,000/
25,000 depending on FIES's fiber/mode) -- despite the database's broader
scope (INT and others, per IACOB's own published description), this SSA
service's public rows are Mercator/HERMES and NOT/FIES only.
