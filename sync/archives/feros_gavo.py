"""FEROS Public Spectra (GAVO Heidelberg) — TAP, no positions, name-only match.

Not the same thing as FEROS data already pulled in via eso.py: this is a
small, separate GAVO-hosted DaCHS/SSA service covering FEROS's commissioning
and guaranteed-time spectra from 1999 (MJD 51093-51394), entirely before
ESO's own archive coverage starts (earliest FEROS row there is MJD 52955,
observed) — disjoint date ranges, not a duplicate.

Final, static dataset (FEROS moved fully into ESO's regular archive after
guaranteed time ended) — one full pull is enough forever, same shape as
rave.py.

feros.data has no position column populated at all (observed:
COUNT(ssa_targetpos) is 0 across all 2359 real spectra) — every record here
can only ever go through the matcher's name_resolved path, never
positional_easy_match. Records whose ssa_targname doesn't resolve to a
tracked star are silently skipped, same outcome positional matching would
give a non-tracked target anyway.

Each real spectrum has a paired application/x-votable+xml metadata-only row
alongside its application/fits row (observed: exactly 2x count) —
filtered out via the mime column rather than deduping client-side.
