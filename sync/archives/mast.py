"""MAST (HST, IUE, FUSE, EUVE, HUT, TUES, BEFS, WUPPE) — VO-TAP service at mast.stsci.edu/vo-tap/, no native Gaia column.

The old objid/obsid reconciliation concern turns out to be moot: each
ivoa.obscore row already carries a directly-usable access_url (verified
— a 722KB FITS file, 200 OK), so there's no need to reconcile
namespaces to build a deep link at all.

TAP endpoint found by reading the VO-TAP landing page's own nav links (no
docs page listed it directly): mast.stsci.edu/vo-tap/api/v0.1/caom exposes
ivoa.obscore. Real ADQL, real TAP_SCHEMA.

Originally scoped to obs_collection='HST' with access_format='application/
fits' (filters out the thumbnail/preview jpgs that share the same obs_id).
Extended to IUE and FUSE: the same dataproduct_type='spectrum' filter
works for both (955,434 / 1,532,075 total rows respectively), but their
access_format is 'image/fits', not HST's 'application/fits' — this is
the entire reason the original "not yet checked" note existed, not a
genuine access problem.

IUE/FUSE need one more thing HST didn't: a single obs_id there returns many
rows, one per processing stage/file (raw, calibrated, housekeeping,
trailer logs, ...) — observed, one IUE obs_id alone had 6 variants,
one FUSE obs_id had 15. HST's access_format filter already yields exactly
one row per obs_id on its own, so this never showed up before. Both IUE
and FUSE consistently expose one clearly-canonical merged/calibrated
product per observation, named with a `_vo.fits` suffix (e.g.
"lwr01024mxlo_vo.fits", "i801010100000nvo4ttagfcal_vo.fits") — MAST's own
"VO-ready" product convention, not something specific to either mission.
Tried filtering this in SQL directly (`access_url LIKE '%_vo.fits'`) but a
leading-wildcard LIKE hit a genuine 504 Gateway Timeout on this service —
deduped client-side instead: within each fetched page, group by obs_id and
keep the `_vo.fits` variant when present, otherwise the first row seen.
Harmless no-op for HST (already exactly one row per obs_id, so "first row
seen" is the only row either way) — this dedup applies uniformly across
all three collections rather than special-casing HST out of it.

No cliff found for obs_collection='HST' alone — unlike CADC (used for
gemini.py/cfht_cadc.py), ORDER BY t_min is fast here (20,000 rows in 0.7s,
no truncation). Re-observed with IUE/FUSE included in the same
query (despite the extra per-obs_id row multiplicity): still no cliff.
Standard TOP+ORDER BY+watermark pagination works.

Still not covered: obs_collection='JWST' hit a genuine 504 Gateway Timeout
on the very query shape that works for HST/IUE/FUSE — a real server-side
issue, not a row-count or sort cliff, needs its own investigation pass.

s_ra/s_dec can be masked on real rows (calibration exposures like WAVE/
DEUTERIUM lamp exposures lack real sky coordinates) — observed, it
crashes the matcher's KD-tree build outright if not handled (NaN, not just
wrong). Filtered via clean_float + dropping records with no position, same
as the existing ra/dec-required check in sync.matcher.

Extended to 5 more historical UV rocket/shuttle missions living in this same
obscore table, found via a VO SSA-registry sweep (their own registered SSA
services point at archive.stsci.edu, but the same rows are already present
here in the CAOM table this module already queries): EUVE (9,830 rows), HUT
(8,726), TUES (4,678), BEFS (2,719), WUPPE (1,429) — all observed with
real HD-star target names and the same access_format='image/fits' shape as
EUVE above. Genuinely a same-day extension: no new endpoint, no new query
shape, just 5 more values in obs_collection.

Note on BEFS specifically: a handful of obs_ids have 2-4 rows *all* ending
in the canonical `_vo.fits` suffix (e.g. befs1002_spa1_vo.fits through
_spd1_vo.fits, observed, same obs_id/target_name) — real distinct
per-channel spectral segments of one exposure, not duplicates. The existing
dedup (first `_vo.fits` row wins per obs_id) picks one of them as the
representative link for that observation, same "one holding per exposure"
simplification this project already makes elsewhere (e.g. naoj.py picking
one product per raw_id) rather than modeling sub-exposure channels as
separate holdings.

Deliberately NOT extended to GALEX, despite 1.56M real dataproduct_type=
'spectrum' rows existing in this same table — GALEX's primary mode is UV
imaging/photometry; those rows are slitless-grism spectra in often-crowded
fields, plausibly lower and more variable quality/blending than the
dedicated single-object spectrometers above. Worth a data-quality sanity
pass before adding, not a same-day extension like the 5 above.
