"""ING Archive (WHT/INT/JKT via CASU) -- metadata-only, no file retrieval.

The old archive.ast.cam.ac.uk is dead/decommissioned (observed,
connection refused from two independent networks) -- the live one is
casu.ast.cam.ac.uk/casuadc/ingarch, a TurboGears web-form app with no
TAP/VO/REST API. `displayResults` (POST, multipart/form-data) is the query
endpoint; observed that the `telescope` <select> field must be
present in the POST body even when blank, or the server 500s (a real
TurboGears form-validation quirk, not a documented requirement).

This module deliberately does NOT retrieve actual FITS files -- ING's only
bulk-download path is a stateful, session-tied, email-gated async job
queue (POST recno selections -> POST an email address -> a bare numeric
Job ID is returned -> the archive emails a download link once the job
completes, observed end-to-end with a throwaway address). No
status-check endpoint exists to poll instead of reading email (confirmed:
several guessed endpoints all 404). Since every archive_url in this
project is already just a pointer to where the source archive keeps the
file -- nothing here downloads and stores bytes itself -- there's no need
to build that email/job infrastructure: archive_url instead points at
`displayHeader?recno=...`, a real, directly-fetchable page (no session
needed, confirmed 200) showing that observation's FITS header, the same
role the search-portal link plays for lbt.py (which also has no
direct-file URL).

Spectroscopy only: the `instrument` text field does real server-side
substring filtering (observed: `instrument=ISIS` returns only
WHT/ISIS red/blue arm rows, nothing else) -- used directly rather than
pulling every instrument and filtering client-side. Only WHT/ISIS is
covered. WHT/ACAM and WHT/LIRIS are dual-mode (imaging AND spectroscopy)
and the default result columns don't expose a mode/grism field to tell
which is which for a given exposure -- deliberately excluded rather than
guessing, same reasoning noirlab.py gives for its own excluded tables.
`telescope=WHT` is also passed directly (ISIS only exists there) to keep
result pages smaller.

Real science frames have `obs_type` (a results column, not a form field)
== "TARGET" -- ARC/BIAS/FLAT/SKY calibration frames are excluded via that
check, observed across a real month of data. Some TARGET frames are
engineering pointings (e.g. "FOCRUN-1/9" focus-run sequences) rather than
real stars -- left in rather than hand-filtered further, since those
simply fail to resolve to a tracked star downstream, the same outcome a
bespoke name-based filter would produce (same reasoning lick.py gives for
not hand-filtering its own free-text labels).

Coordinates are real sexagesimal ra/dec on TARGET frames (observed)
but a literal "00:00:00.00 +00:00:00.0" sentinel on calibration/some
engineering frames -- treated as no-position rather than passed through,
same reasoning harpsn_tng.py's OBJECT!='NONE' filter gives for its own
RA=DEC=0.0 sentinel (a real position match near RA=0/Dec=0 would otherwise
be a live risk).

Pagination: no offset/watermark field exists on this form at all -- a
blank/wide query just silently caps at "Displaying only the first 1000"
with no total count and no way to page past it (observed). Walked
instead as an adaptive calendar-window crawl on `nightobs` (which accepts
a real "YYYYMMDD..YYYYMMDD" range, observed), similar in spirit to
lick.py's calendar walk but self-adjusting: a window that comes back
truncated gets bisected (retried at half the size) until it doesn't, and
an accepted window's size grows back up afterward (capped) since coverage
density varies a lot across ING's ~40-year history. Same "keep scanning
until a window finds something, so a real-but-empty window doesn't fool
the generic stop-on-zero driver" concern as lick.py's own docstring
documents, adapted for a variable window size instead of a fixed one.
