"""NEID (WIYN telescope, Kitt Peak) -- TAP (neidl2), no native Gaia column.

Real, standards-compliant, no-auth TAP service at neid.ipac.caltech.edu/TAP/sync
-- observed via TAP_SCHEMA.tables, which lists real tables neidl1/neidl2
(L1/L2 extracted, wavelength-calibrated 1D spectra) plus solar variants
neidsolarl1/neidsolarl2 (NEID's dedicated solar feed -- the Sun, not a star,
excluded) and neidl1_all/neidl2_all/neidsolar*_all (unexplored, not used).
neidl2 is used here, not neidl1: per its own TAP_SCHEMA description it's the
fully wavelength-calibrated, RV-ready extracted-spectrum tier, the more
appropriate "final science product" of the two. Backed by an Oracle database,
not the DaCHS/PostgreSQL engine behind most other TAP archives in this
project -- observed: a malformed nested-subquery test surfaced a
literal "ORA-00937: not a single-group group function" error.

Real columns confirmed via TAP_SCHEMA.columns and a sample query:
expid (int, real per-exposure primary key), object (target/frame name),
obstype ('Eng'/'Sci' -- 21,518 Sci / 16 Eng of 21,534 total rows, no other
values), datalvl (uniformly 2 across the *entire* table --
neidl2 only ever holds the fully-reduced L2 tier, no raw/partial rows
co-mingled the way naoj.py's single table has to disambiguate), obsdate (a
string whose first 10 characters are already a plain ISO date -- used
directly rather than parsing the full variable-precision timestamp),
obsjd (float Julian Date -- observed 0 nulls and 0 duplicate values
across the whole table, unlike xmm.py/naoj.py this needs no tie-handling
as a watermark), tcsra/tcsdec/tcsrad/tcsdecd (the real telescope-pointing
coordinates for that exposure, observed 0 nulls) vs qra/qdec/qrad/
qdecd (the queue/planned target's catalog coordinates, kept separate --
tcsrad/tcsdecd is what's used here as ra/dec), program, obsmode ('hr'/'he'
fiber mode -- 19,667/1,867 of 21,534, observed 0 nulls), and
simbadmainid (a SIMBAD name the pipeline itself has already resolved, e.g.
'HD  89269' -- not read here since this project's own generic
discover_stars step does that independently, but it corroborates that
object/raw_target_name is genuinely resolvable).

987 distinct object names observed, topped by real, well-known bright
RV-survey targets: HD 10700 (Tau Ceti, 1,062 obs), HD 185144, HD 127334,
HD 89269, HD 26965 (40 Eri A, 181 obs), HD 219134, alongside occasional
solar-system calibration targets (e.g. 'Venus', 276 obs) and a small number
(19 of 21,534, observed) of LFC/"Cal"-named hybrid calibration-during-
science frames -- left unfiltered rather than hand-excluded, same "simply
fails to resolve downstream" reasoning gtc.py gives for its own unfiltered
free-text object names.

No cliff found: a single unbounded TOP 50000 pull (real headroom over the
confirmed 21,534-row total) returns in ~9s -- standard TOP+watermark on
obsjd, same shape as dao.py/mast.py.

archive_url: this table has no ObsCore access_url-equivalent column, and the
archive's own web frontend (neid.ipac.caltech.edu/search.php) is a Firefly-
based single-page app (observed -- its HTML explicitly references
"firefly") with no discoverable static per-exposure deep link (guessed
getdata.php/getfile.php direct-file endpoints both observed 404) --
archive_url instead points at that general search portal, same "point at a
real page in the home archive, not a fabricated deep link" convention as
lbt.py's own no-direct-file-URL case.

An 18-month proprietary period applies to the actual FITS data, but not to
this TAP metadata -- observed that very recent (2026-02) exposures are
already fully populated here (real target name, real tcsra/tcsdec, real
obsjd), same "an embargoed row still answers this project's core question"
convention as salt_hrs.py/harpsn_tng.py including their own embargoed rows.

reduction_status is hardcoded 'reduced': neidl2 is specifically the
pipeline's final wavelength-calibrated, RV-ready extracted-spectrum tier
(datalvl=2 on literally every row, observed), unlike naoj.py's single
table mixing raw/reduced product tiers that need disambiguating.

INSTRUMENT_RESOLVING_POWER / INSTRUMENT_WAVELENGTH_RANGE_NM (webapp/app.py)
deliberately do NOT gain entries for NEID here, despite the task brief's own
suggested range (R ~ 110,000-190,000) -- multiple live lookups attempted
this session (NEID/PSU/NOIRLab/Wikipedia pages, the arXiv and Semantic
Scholar APIs) all failed to turn up a citable published number (dead links,
empty responses, or rate-limited), so this is left out rather than guessed,
same fallback convention that dict's own comment block documents for other
unconfirmed instruments.
