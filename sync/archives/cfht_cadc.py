"""CFHT via CADC — TAP (ivoa.ObsCore), no native Gaia column.

The TAP endpoint isn't the guessable /tap or /youcat/tap path — it's
resolved from the ivo://cadc.nrc.ca/argus registry identifier (confirmed via
astroquery.cadc, which does this resolution internally) to
https://ws.cadc-ccda.hia-iha.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/argus.

Real cliff found live, not just "byte/time-bounded" as previously noted:
10,000 rows in 6s, 20,000 in 11.4s (~linear), but 30,000 in 59.7s — a sharp
non-linear jump, not gradual degradation. Paginating well under that.

No Gaia column on ivoa.ObsCore — positional match, same shape as eso.py.
Deep link is the standard DataLink resolver URL (constructible directly from
obs_publisher_did, no per-record extra request needed) rather than the
resolved direct-file canfar.net URL — resolving that for every record during
sync isn't practical at this scale (831,455 CFHT spectrum rows), but the
DataLink URL itself is observed to resolve to a real downloadable FITS
file one click further in.

No calibration-frame filter: caom2.Observation.target_type='object' would
exclude things like "Polarized Flat Q" calibration exposures, but the join
needed to reach it (ObsCore has no intent/target_type of its own) made an
already-slow query much slower — not worth it. Calibration rows just flow
through and get harmlessly skipped by the matcher (their positions won't
coincide with a tracked star), at the cost of some wasted row-processing.

Positional-match caveat, found live and not a matcher bug: a real target
(Stein 2051 A / Gl169.1A, a known visual binary) failed to match within 1"
even after correct proper-motion propagation — Gaia's single-star
astrometric solution can be biased for astrometric binaries, so its
proper motion doesn't always predict the star's true position. The matcher
correctly skipped rather than force a wrong match; this is a real Gaia data
quality limit the "easy match" design accepts and defers, not a bug.

s_ra/s_dec read via clean_float — can be masked on real rows (confirmed as a
real pattern via mast.py), and a bare float() would turn that into NaN and
crash the matcher's KD-tree build outright.
