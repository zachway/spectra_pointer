Real TAP endpoint (jvo.nao.ac.jp/skynode/do/tap/moircs, table public.raw) confirmed live, filtered to obs_mode IN (''SPEC'', ''SPEC_MOS'') to isolate 36,604 real dispersed-spectrum rows from 89,858 imaging rows (obs_mode=IMAG) and other non-science modes. Same JVOQL quirks as HDS -- COUNT(DISTINCT ...) silently ignored (confirmed live), FORMAT=csv ignored, 200,000-row RECORD_MAX cap -- but SELECT * fails for a different reason here (`column t0.center_ra does not exist`, confirmed live, not HDS''s malformed access_estsize column). Unlike HDS, no per-exposure pipeline-product dedup needed -- every row is a genuinely distinct FITS frame from one of MOIRCS'' two separate detector chips (confirmed live via a live GROUP BY data_id HAVING COUNT(*) > 1 returning zero rows). ref_val1/ref_val2 confirmed live to be plain FK5 J2000 RA/Dec in degrees, not a WCS reference needing conversion. Paginated via an id integer watermark, no cliff found (whole 36,604-row set fetched in one ~6.4s query).'),

No sky-crawl needed: POS=0,0 with SIZE=360 (a full-sky cone search) returns a stable, convergent 1,255-row whole-archive total in one request (confirmed live at multiple SIZE values approaching and exceeding 180 degrees). The response''s TIME field is declared an invalid VOTable datatype (TIMESTAMP, confirmed live -- astropy/pyvo reject the whole response outright), so it''s parsed via a plain regex TR/TD walk instead of astropy''s VOTable parser. SSA''s TIME range filter errors out on this service (confirmed live) -- no incremental watermark is available, so this does one full pull and no-ops thereafter via a synced_at cursor, same shape as feros_gavo.py/elodie.py, though unlike those this is a documented current limitation (Mercator/NOT are still operating telescopes) rather than a genuinely finished dataset.

These are SSA cone-search services, not TAP, but each one''s own search-form help text advertises "Maximum Search Radius allowed: 180 degrees" as a genuine radius (confirmed live: identical ~985-row MILES result from two different POS centers at SIZE=180) -- so one SIZE=180 query per library pulls its entire static catalog in a single page, no sky-grid crawl needed. Column names are not uniform across the five (independently configured SVOCat instances) -- per-collection field map in sync/archives/svo_cab.py.

RGS1 and RGS2 kept as two separate holdings (real, physically distinct simultaneous gratings, same reasoning as Chandra''s HETG/LETG) -- their exposure_id is not unique per observation on its own (confirmed live: RGS1 and RGS2 can share the same exposure_id), so archive_obs_id keys on observation_id+instrument+exposure_id together. A single unbounded TOP 50000 pull (real headroom over the confirmed total) returns in ~3s, avoiding a windowed-pagination boundary landing on one of the 5,116 start_utc timestamps shared by both gratings'' simultaneous exposures. proprietary_end_date is a real, populated embargo field (confirmed live future dates) but not filtered on, same as salt_hrs.py -- embargoed rows still answer whether a star has been observed at all. archive_url points at nxsa-web/#obsid=... -- confirmed real via the archive''s own compiled GWT JS bundle, which literally parses an ''obsid='' history token, not a guessed URL. reduction_status left unset -- no calib_level-equivalent column exists on either table.');


-- =============================================================================
-- Crowdsourced triage for skipped spectroscopy_holdings rows (design sketch).
--
-- No automated heuristic in sync/matcher.py is trustworthy enough to resolve
-- match_status = 'skipped' rows on its own (see the comment on that column
-- above) -- these need a human to look at the raw name/position and a finder
-- chart and pick one of a fixed set of outcomes. A single careless or
-- bad-faith submission attaching the wrong gaia_source_id would be just as
-- damaging as a bad automated heuristic, so submissions do NOT write
-- directly to spectroscopy_holdings/stars. Instead they accumulate here, one
-- row per independent submission, keyed to the holding by
-- (archive_code, archive_obs_id) -- the same pair spectroscopy_holdings
-- already uses as its own UNIQUE constraint -- rather than by `id`, so this
-- table doesn't need to assume anything about spectroscopy_holdings' or
-- stars' primary key shape (a separate, concurrent migration is adding
-- alternate-catalog identifiers to `stars` for Gaia-absent bright stars like
-- Arcturus -- see project notes -- and may change how stars are keyed).
--
-- Applying a submission (updating spectroscopy_holdings / calling
-- ingest.add_star's add_star()/add_star_by_name()) only happens once a
-- quorum of independent submissions agree -- see the TODO on the /triage
-- routes in webapp/app.py for exactly where that stub lives. Left
