"""One-off: upgrade harpsn_tng's stored archive_url from the raw exposure
frame to the best available DRS-reduced 1D spectrum, where one exists.

sync/archives/harpsn_tng.py deliberately anchors one spectroscopy_holdings
row per physical exposure on the bare raw frame (see that module's
docstring) -- every DRS pipeline product for an exposure shares one exposure
timestamp but gets its own `id` in tng.TNG_TAP, and the raw frame is the only
one of these guaranteed to exist for every exposure back to 2012-07-17. That
fix is about *counting* (one row per exposure, not up to 18), not about
*which file* the row points at -- rows still end up with archive_url pointing
at a raw, non-science-ready FITS frame, unlike every other 'reduced'-tagged
archive in this project (bess, cfht_cadc, eso, gemini, mast, naoj, ...).

Why this can't just be folded into harpsn_tng.py's fetch(): observed
(2026-08-04) that a reduced product's `id` is NOT reliably close to its raw
sibling's `id`. Old-pipeline products (lowercase e2ds/s1d/ccf/bis) do land
near the raw frame's id (generated near-real-time alongside ingestion), but
the new-pipeline reprocessing (uppercase S1D/S2D/CCF, "r.HARPN." prefix) was
inserted as a separate, later bulk campaign -- sampling id blocks near the
current watermark (id ~4.39M) found ~448 reprocessed exposures' worth of
r.HARPN products but only 15 raw siblings in that same 12,574-id window, i.e.
most raw counterparts for even *recent* reprocessed exposures sit far away in
id-space. fetch()'s single forward pass over an id-ordered cursor can't
correctly prefer a reduced product without either (a) unbounded lookahead
before emitting any row, which breaks incremental pagination for every
archive that shares this id-watermark shape (asiago.py too), or (b) silently
missing upgrades that land outside the current page -- neither acceptable.
Doing it here instead, as a full separate pass with the entire id-space
available before any decision is made, sidesteps the ordering problem
entirely.

Priority per exposure (best first) -- picks fiber A, since that's the
science-target fiber in HARPS-N's normal setup (fiber B carries sky or the
simultaneous ThAr/FP reference):
  1. r.HARPN...S1D_FLUXCAL_A.fits.gz   (new pipeline, flux+wavelength cal'd)
  2. r.HARPN...S1D_A.fits.gz           (new pipeline, merged 1D spectrum)
  3. r.HARPN...S1D_SKYSUB_FLUXCAL_A.fits.gz  (new pipeline, sky-sub mode)
  4. r.HARPN...S1D_SKYSUB_A.fits.gz          (new pipeline, sky-sub mode)
  5. HARPN...s1d_A.fits.gz             (old pipeline, merged 1D spectrum)
  6. (nothing found -> leave the raw frame, reduction_status='raw')
S2D (unmerged per-order, not a single spectrum) and CCF (a cross-correlation
function, not a spectrum) are deliberately excluded from every tier -- they
exist for nearly every exposure but aren't "the spectrum" a user asking for
HARPS-N data would expect.

Two-pass design, same shape as scripts/backfill_reduction_status.py's
"expensive" archives:
  1. Scan the full INSTRUMENT='HARPN' AND policy='FREE' table once, id-
     watermarked same as harpsn_tng.py itself, building an in-memory dict of
     exposure-timestamp -> best (priority, url) found so far. No OBS_MODE/
     OBJECT filter here (unlike the live sync's own query) -- cheaper to
     just index everything than to risk missing a product whose own row
     happens to carry a stale/blank OBJECT value.
  2. Re-scan spectroscopy_holdings rows for archive_code='harpsn_tng' with
     reduction_status='unknown' (matches the idiom scripts/
     backfill_reduction_status.py already established -- new rows a normal
     sync inserts always start 'unknown', so re-running this script later
     safely picks up newly-synced or newly-reprocessed exposures without
     re-touching rows it already upgraded), extract each row's own exposure
     timestamp from its *current* (raw) archive_url, look it up in the
     dict, and UPDATE archive_url + reduction_status accordingly.

Expected to need periodic re-runs, same as the other 'expensive' backfills in
backfill_reduction_status.py -- IA2's reprocessing lags real-time ingestion,
so a freshly-synced exposure often won't have its S1D counterpart yet.

IA2's TAP service showed real instability today (2026-08-04): a plain
INSTRUMENT-bound query intermittently returned "Time out! ... limited to 0
seconds" with no load from this project active at the time, separate from
the unrelated page-40 failure harpsn_tng.py's own sync hit earlier in the
day. Retries with backoff below, same pattern backfill_reduction_status.py
uses for CADC's own intermittent stalls -- don't run this back-to-back with
a fresh harpsn_tng sync; give IA2 a quiet window.
