"""One-off: track every star in the Yale Bright Star Catalogue (BSC5), not
just the ones Gaia is missing.

scripts.seed_bsc5_bright_stars only seeded the ~70 BSC5 stars confirmed
absent from Gaia. This is the complement: the other ~9,000+ BSC5 stars
that DO have a Gaia counterpart, added via the normal Gaia path
(ingest.add_star.add_stars_batch) instead of source_catalog='bsc5' -- so
every naked-eye star ends up tracked one way or another, not just the ones
some archive happened to already report.

Cross-matches the full BSC5 catalog (VizieR V/50/catalog) against
gaiadr3.gaia_source in chunks (a single ~9,000-row upload/join in one TAP
call is what caused the timeouts/500s seen during the original BSC5-gap
analysis -- see project history). For each BSC star, picks the brightest
Gaia candidate within radius as the match, but only trusts it if it isn't
implausibly faint (>3 mag fainter than the BSC star's own Vmag is almost
certainly an unrelated neighbor/artifact, not the star itself -- same
sanity check used to build the original 70-star gap list). Anything with
no credible Gaia match at all gets added via add_bsc_star instead --
should only be the ~70 already-known ones, but computed fresh here rather
than hardcoded, in case this ever needs re-running against a newer Gaia
data release.

Every star, Gaia- or BSC5-sourced, gets "HR <n>" seeded as a known alias
(SIMBAD recognizes this directly, and it's always available regardless of
whether the star has a Bayer/Flamsteed name) plus the BSC5 Name field where
present -- so an archive reporting a bright star by its HR designation
matches immediately, not just the ones ingest.add_star.add_bsc_star already
covers via SIMBAD's full alias list.
