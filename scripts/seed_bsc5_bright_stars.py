"""One-off: seed the naked-eye stars Gaia can't see at all.

Gaia saturates on the very brightest stars in the sky. A cross-match of the
Yale Bright Star Catalogue (BSC5, via VizieR's V/50/catalog) against
gaiadr3.gaia_source (30" radius, accounting for stale BSC positions plus
real proper motion on nearby bright stars) found that of the 170 BSC5 stars
brighter than V=3, these 70 have no credible Gaia counterpart: 18 with zero
Gaia sources within 30" at all, another 52 where the closest candidate is
>3 mag fainter than expected (almost certainly an unrelated neighbor, not
the star itself — Gaia often has spurious faint detections near bright
stars from diffraction spikes). Past V=3 the effect drops off fast (1.3%
of BSC5 stars in 3<=V<5 show the same pattern), so this list -- a one-time
run against production -- isn't expected to need much revisiting.

Arcturus is HR 5340, in this list.

Usage:
