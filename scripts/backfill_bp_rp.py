"""One-off: backfill phot_bp_mean_mag/phot_rp_mean_mag for stars added
before those columns existed.

Doesn't touch anything else — a dedicated re-query of Gaia by
gaia_source_id, same batched-TAP-query pattern as
ingest.add_star.add_stars_batch, but scoped to just these two columns so
it's safe to run against the full tracked-star catalog (1M+ rows and
growing) without re-doing any of the archive sync/matching work. Resumable:
only selects rows where both columns are still NULL, so a re-run after a
partial run (or a Gaia TAP outage mid-way) just picks up where it left
off — and doesn't keep re-querying stars where Gaia itself has no BP or RP
measurement (a real, permanent null, not a "not backfilled yet" one).

Usage:
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql:///spectra_local python3 -m scripts.backfill_bp_rp
