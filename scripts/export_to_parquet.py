"""One-off/periodic: export the live Postgres tables to Parquet files where
joy's Apache can serve them directly.

webapp.app no longer holds a live DATABASE_URL connection — it reads a
Parquet snapshot over plain HTTP instead (see its module docstring). That
snapshot needs to land somewhere joy's Apache (mod_userdir) already serves
publicly, e.g. ~/public_html/spectra_data on morgan — since morgan and joy
share the same NFS home directory, writing there is enough, no separate
publish/sync step. This script is the only thing besides sync.main and
ingest.add_star that still talks to the real Postgres database. There is no
automatic trigger — run it by hand (or your own cron) whenever you want the
hosted search to pick up a run's worth of sync results.

Usage:
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql:///spectra_local \\
    python3 -m scripts.export_to_parquet --out-dir ~/public_html/spectra_data

# Fully precomputed Leaderboard chart data — not just the raw per-(star,
# period) counts, but the actual top-N-per-period selection webapp.app plots.
#
# First cut of this only moved the raw GROUP BY here and left webapp.app to
# pick the top 5 per period in Python — that GROUP BY alone still produces
# one row per (star, period) with no cap on distinct stars, and this catalog
# tracks millions of stars (DESI/SDSS-V/LAMOST alone put it past 2M), so the
# "aggregated, therefore small" assumption baked into the old in-app version
# was wrong at this catalog's actual scale. webapp.app was then calling
# Python's sorted() over the full ~2M-star population once per period
# (~70+ periods, x2 for both the within-period and cumulative rankings) just
# to keep the top 5 -- confirmed live as what was actually driving the OOM
# (1.1GB+) even after the raw-GROUP-BY-only version of this fix shipped.
#
# Second cut moved the ranking into one SQL query using window functions
# over a star x period grid (cross join, needed so a star's cumulative
# total carries forward through periods where it had no new observations,
# and can still rank). That worked at ~2M stars / ~70 periods, but LAMOST
# pushed the real star count with dated observations to 6.1M -- a 6.1M x
# 74 = ~453M row grid -- which OOM'd DuckDB's 24.9 GiB memory_limit even
# with disk-spilling enabled (temp_directory set), confirmed live. The
# grid was always ~60x bigger than it needed to be: only ~7.3M (star,
# period) pairs actually have any observations at all.
#
# Rewritten below to never materialize that grid:
#   - Within-period top-N doesn't need it at all -- a star with zero new
#     observations this period can never outrank one with a positive
#     count, so ranking directly against the real (star, period, n) rows
#     (no zero-filled ones) gives the same top-N.
#   - Cumulative top-N does need every active star's running total as of
#     each period (including periods where it didn't newly observe), but
#     that's a sweep, not a cross join: walk the ~74 periods in order,
#     keep one running total per star ever observed (bounded by star
#     count, not star x period), and snapshot the top-N after each
#     period's update. Same ranking result as the old grid-based window
#     function, without ever holding more than one row per star.
#   - Only once the (small, low tens-of-thousands) set of stars that ever
#     made top-N by either metric is known does a star x period grid get

# Star-overlap between archives/instruments -- backs the /instruments page's
# overlap heatmap and Venn-diagram picker. A live per-request version would
# need either a full self-join of spectroscopy_holdings against itself (a
# multi-million-row x multi-million-row join for the biggest archives) or a
# GROUP BY over the whole table, same OOM-shaped risk as everything else
# precomputed here.
#
# Both queries take the same shape: first collapse each star down to the
# small array of distinct archives/instruments its *matched* holdings span
# (bounded by however many archives ever observed that one star -- typically
# 1-3, rarely more than a handful even for the most-studied stars), then
# UNNEST that array against itself (twice, for pairs; three times, for
# triples) and count. This is NOT a cross join over the full table -- the
# per-star arrays are what's crossed, so the work for one star is k^2 (or
# k^3) where k is that star's own small archive/instrument count, not the
# catalog's total row count. a<=b(<=c) keeps only one ordering per
# unordered pair/triple and, as a side effect, includes the a==b(==c)
# "self-pair" -- that's not wasted: it's exactly each set's own total
# distinct-star count, so the heatmap's diagonal and the Venn picker's
# per-circle totals come from this same query instead of a separate one.
# The GROUP BY also means a combo that never co-occurs for any star simply
# has no output row at all (implicit zero) rather than an explicit zero row
# -- archive_overlap(_triple) stays small on its own (low hundreds of rows,
# bounded by the handful of archive codes that exist). Instrument overlap
# needed an explicit cap instead: confirmed live that ~450+ distinct
# instrument names made instrument_overlap_triple balloon to ~6.8M rows (not
# "nowhere near N^3" as originally assumed here) -- webapp.app's /instruments

# Import pending /triage classification submissions (design sketch).
#
# webapp.app's /triage/submit route has no live Postgres access (see its
# module docstring) -- it appends one JSON line per submission to a public
# file on joy instead, over a narrowly-scoped, forced-command-restricted SSH
# connection (see webapp/app.py's _append_triage_submission and
# scripts/joy_triage_append.py). This is the other half: reads that same
# file (this script already runs on/near joy, with local filesystem access
# to the same directory it just wrote the Parquet snapshot to) and imports
# each line into the real skip_classifications table.
#
# Idempotent by construction, not by tracking an offset: every run re-reads
# the *entire* file and INSERTs with ON CONFLICT (archive_code,
# archive_obs_id, submitter) DO NOTHING, relying on skip_classifications'
# existing one-vote-per-submitter unique index -- a line that was already
# imported on a previous run just inserts 0 rows the second time, so there's
# no offset/cursor state to track or get out of sync. The file is
# deliberately never truncated -- this feature's traffic is human-submission
# scale, re-scanning it every run costs nothing worth optimizing for.

    """Design stub -- NOT called anywhere yet. Sketching the intended
    consensus step so it's clear what's deferred and why, per the crowdsourced-
    triage design notes. Lives here rather than in webapp.app because this
    is the only piece of the pipeline with live Postgres access at all now
    (see import_triage_submissions above and webapp.app's module docstring).

    Intended logic once wired up (e.g. right after import_triage_submissions
    processes a batch): tally this holding's not-yet-applied
    skip_classifications rows grouped by outcome; if any one outcome has
    >= `quorum` independent submitters agreeing:
      - attach_gaia_source: call ingest.add_star.add_star(pg_conn,
        proposed_gaia_source_id, input_name=...) (see add_star.py:188) to
        fetch-and-track the star if it isn't already tracked, then UPDATE the
        matching spectroscopy_holdings row to that star with
        match_status='matched', match_method='manual'.
      - attach_bright_star: call ingest.add_star.add_bsc_star(pg_conn,
        proposed_bsc_hr_number, input_name=...) (see add_star.py:275) --
        same idea as attach_gaia_source, but for a naked-eye star Gaia never
        saw, tracked via bsc_hr_number instead of gaia_source_id.
      - not_a_real_target / not_a_star: UPDATE spectroscopy_holdings.match_status =
        'rejected' (already a valid value in the match_status CHECK
        constraint -- see db/schema.sql). Both are terminal in the same way;
        kept as separate outcomes only so the vote itself stays informative
        (junk data vs. a real non-stellar object) rather than for any
        difference in how they're applied here.
      - confirmed_absent_from_gaia: no spectroscopy_holdings change (there's
        genuinely no gaia_source_id/star to assign) -- just mark applied so
        the row stops resurfacing in the /triage queue.
      - Mark every skip_classifications row for this holding applied_at =
        now(), not just the winning outcome's rows, so disagreeing/minority
        submissions don't linger as "pending" forever once a decision is made.

    Open design questions this stub deliberately leaves unresolved:
      - Exact quorum size (2 above is a placeholder) -- should it scale with
        total submission count, or require a margin over the runner-up
        outcome rather than a flat count?
      - What happens if two different outcomes both individually reach quorum
        (shouldn't happen if one-vote-per-submitter holds and quorum requires
        genuine agreement, but worth a real tie-break rule before this goes
        live, not just an assumption)?
      - Should a submitter ever be able to revise their own vote? Currently
        blocked outright by db/schema.sql's one-vote-per-submitter unique
        index -- deliberate for this sketch, but worth revisiting.
