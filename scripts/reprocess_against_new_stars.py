"""One-off: reprocess archive holdings that might resolve differently now
that a large batch of new stars (e.g. the full BSC5 catalog, via
scripts.seed_bright_star_catalog) has been added to `stars`.

Two distinct populations, reprocessed for two distinct reasons:

1. Every currently skipped/needs_review holding, across every archive, no
   time window -- the straightforward case: a record whose raw_target_name
   or position previously had no tracked-star candidate at all might now
   match one of the newly-added stars.

2. Existing MATCHED holdings (match_method='positional_easy_match') whose
   assigned star sits suspiciously close to one of the newly-added stars.
   This is the sharper risk, not just "might now match": a record that
   should have matched a bright star which wasn't tracked yet could have
   positionally matched some OTHER nearby tracked star instead -- most
   dangerously one of Gaia's own spurious detections near a bright/
   saturated source (diffraction-spike artifacts), if that spurious source
   happened to already be tracked. That holding shows up as 'matched'
   today, not 'skipped', so population #1 alone would never re-examine it.
   Found via a q3c self-join on stars(ra,dec) -- cheap, since it's
   new-star-count x nearby-old-star count, not new-star-count x
   all-holdings, so it doesn't need a new index on
   spectroscopy_holdings(raw_ra,raw_dec).

Both populations get replayed through the exact same
sync.matcher.match_records used for live syncs (same chunked,
incrementally-committed pattern as scripts.reprocess_skipped), so the same
identifier-before-position priority and ambiguity handling applies: a
genuinely better match wins, a newly-ambiguous one correctly demotes to
needs_review for a human to look at rather than silently staying wrong.

Population #1 at full catalog scale (millions of skipped/needs_review
rows) is a real, possibly many-hour job even chunked -- unlike the star_id
schema migration this doesn't hold one giant open transaction (each chunk
commits via matcher.match_records itself), so it's safe to let run and
safe to interrupt/resume by re-invoking (already-resolved rows just won't
still be 'skipped' on the next pass), but budget accordingly before
kicking it off against production.

    Comparing stars' raw stored (ra, dec) directly here would be wrong for
    exactly the reason this whole script exists: a high-PM star's stored
    position (BSC5-sourced stars use ref_epoch=1991.25, Gaia-sourced ones
    2016.0) can differ from where it actually was by many arcseconds --
    observed via HR 15 (pmra/pmdec ~137/-163 mas/yr, ~7.5" of drift
    between its ref_epoch and a 2026 observation date). A radius wide
    enough to cover worst-case multi-decade PM drift would make "nearby"
    meaningless (hundreds of arcsec). Instead, every newly-added star's
    position is propagated (via the exact same sync.matcher._propagate used
    for live positional matching) to each distinct ref_epoch actually
    present among the old stars, so the comparison happens at a shared
    reference epoch -- then NEARBY_OLD_STAR_RADIUS_ARCSEC only needs to
    cover "coincidentally close by chance", the same kind of tolerance
    EASY_MATCH_RADIUS_ARCSEC already relies on elsewhere.
