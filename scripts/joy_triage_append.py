"""Forced SSH command for appending one /triage classification submission to
the public triage_submissions.jsonl file on joy.

This file is NOT run by webapp.app or by anything in this repo automatically
-- it must be copied onto joy by hand and wired up as an authorized_keys
forced command. It is the server-side half of webapp.app's
_append_triage_submission(): that function opens an SSH session and writes
one JSON object to stdin; this script is the only thing that session is ever
allowed to run.

Setup on joy (do this once):
    1. Generate a dedicated keypair just for this -- not your personal key:
           ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/triage_submit_key -N ""
       The private half (~/.ssh/triage_submit_key) goes into Cloud Run's
       Secret Manager as JOY_SSH_KEY_PATH content, never into this repo.
    2. Copy this script onto joy, e.g. ~/bin/joy_triage_append.py.
    3. Add ONE line to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on joy, using the *public*
       half of the key from step 1 and the real target path (matching
       scripts.export_to_parquet's --out-dir):

           command="/usr/bin/python3 /home/you/bin/joy_triage_append.py /home/you/public_html/spectra_data/triage_submissions.jsonl",no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding,no-pty ssh-ed25519 AAAA...

       The `command=` restriction is what actually matters here: no matter
       what the client (webapp.app) asks to execute over that SSH session,
       the server ignores it and always runs this script instead -- so even
       if the private key leaks in full, whoever has it can only ever append
       one well-formed submission line to that one file. They cannot get a
       shell, read other files, or reach Postgres. Observed against a
       throwaway local sshd during development: a session that requested
       `rm -rf / ; cat /etc/passwd` as its exec string still only ever ran
       this script.
    4. Publish the host's public key as JOY_SSH_HOST_KEY (see
       webapp.app._joy_ssh_client's docstring for the exact format) so the
       webapp pins the expected host key instead of trusting on first use.

Deliberately validates the same shape scripts.export_to_parquet's
import_triage_submissions() will later require (required fields, allowed
outcomes, exactly one of raw_target_name/archive_obs_id) -- rejecting a
malformed line here is cheap and immediate; catching it only at the next
export run would mean a silently-dropped submission with no feedback to
the person who submitted it.
