"""Minimal search webpage for the spectra database — single-star search by
Gaia source_id or name, plus a batch upload for a list of either.

Reads a read-only DuckDB view over a Parquet snapshot instead of a live
Postgres connection — this process has no DATABASE_URL and never touches
Postgres at all, not even to write. The snapshot is written by
scripts.export_to_parquet from the real Postgres database (wherever that
runs) directly into morgan's ~/public_html, which joy's Apache (mod_userdir)
already serves publicly — morgan and joy share the same NFS home directory,
so nothing needs to explicitly sync/publish anything. This app reads it
straight over HTTP via DuckDB's httpfs extension (SPECTRA_DATA_URL, what the
hosted Cloud Run service uses), or from a local directory (SPECTRA_DATA_DIR)
for local dev.

The one exception is /triage's classification submissions, which do need to
persist somewhere: rather than opening a write path from this public,
unauthenticated web tier to Postgres, they're appended as JSON lines to
another public file on joy over a narrowly-scoped SSH connection (see
_append_triage_submission / _joy_ssh_client below) and only actually land in
skip_classifications the next time scripts.export_to_parquet runs and
imports them.

Run locally against a local export:
    python3 -m scripts.export_to_parquet --out-dir ./data
    SPECTRA_DATA_DIR=./data python3 -m webapp.app

Run against the hosted snapshot (what Cloud Run does):
    SPECTRA_DATA_URL=http://joy.chara.gsu.edu/~way/spectra_data python3 -m webapp.app

# comment in scripts/export_to_parquet.py for why this file exists and what
# it deliberately leaves out) instead of `stars` -- this is the "search
# unmatched records" checkbox's whole reason to exist: `stars` only has
# rows sync.matcher already resolved to a Gaia/BSC5 counterpart, so a
# record that missed that 1" easy-match cutoff (match_status='skipped') or
# is still sitting in needs_review is otherwise invisible to any radius
# search, no matter how wide.
#
# Same `dec BETWEEN` pre-filter shape as the `stars` query above, matching
# how spectroscopy_holdings_by_position.parquet is sorted (ORDER BY
# raw_dec) so row-group pruning actually applies -- but this file is still
# ~13x more rows than `stars` even after slimming, hence the caveat on the
# checkbox itself that this mode is noticeably slower.
#
# No LIMIT here (unlike the stars-mode query above) -- see
# RADIAL_SEARCH_UNMATCHED_MAX_RADIUS_ARCMIN's comment for why a silent
# row-count truncation was replaced with a tighter radius cap + timeout
# instead. archive_url/archive_obs_id are pulled via a join against the
# main spectroscopy_holdings table directly (rather than collecting ids
# into a separate IN-list query, the previous approach) since an uncapped
# result set could otherwise mean an unbounded parameter list.

  <p class="note">Fixed 6-month periods. At each period, two top-10 lists are computed: the 10 stars with the most cumulative (all-time-so-far) observations, and the 10 with the most observations within that period alone. Every star that ever broke into either list, at any period, gets a line in both charts below — so there can be more than 10 lines total, and a line can start partway through the timeline (whenever that star first qualified) and stop appearing again once it drops out of that period's top 10, rather than dragging a stale line across the whole chart. Only counts holdings with a known observation date — some archives (DESI, SDSS-V) don't report per-observation dates at all, so a star's true total (see Stats below) can be higher than what's reflected here.

A star can have no spectrum from a listed instrument and still be correctly tracked -- this only says the instrument is covered by the sync, not that every star has data from it. Many spectrographs offer several gratings or modes with different R; a range is shown where that's the common case rather than picking one mode arbitrarily.

    # holdings counts span orders of magnitude, and a linear area scale
    # makes the long tail of small instruments render as invisible slivers.
    # Real counts are carried separately in treemap_counts for the
    # label/hover text so the log transform never reaches the reader.
    #
    # Each archive node gets its own explicit log10(archive_total+1) value,
    # and the trace uses branchvalues:'total' (see the JS below) rather than
    # the default 'remainder' mode with a value of 0. Under 'remainder', an
    # archive's box size is the *sum of its children's log values*, which is
    # not the same as the log of the archive's total (log(a)+log(b) !=
    # log(a+b)) -- that made an archive's box size track its instrument
    # *count* almost as much as its holdings total, so an archive with many
    # small instruments could out-size one dominated by a single huge
    # instrument.
    #
    # 'total' mode requires each node's declared value to equal the sum of
    # its children's declared values -- Plotly doesn't renormalize a
    # mismatch itself, it just breaks the layout (an archive with a lot of
    # small instruments can have its children's raw log10(n+1) values sum to
    # many times the archive's own log10(total+1), which blanked the whole
    # chart). So each instrument leaf's value is its log10(n+1) weight
    # rescaled to its share of the archive's own value -- this keeps
    # instruments' relative sizes within an archive exactly as before

  <h2>How matching works</h2>
  <p>Every archive record goes through up to three match methods, tried in this order, and the first one that succeeds wins:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><b>direct_gaia_column</b> — the archive already reports a Gaia DR3 source_id for the record (e.g. DESI, LAMOST, GALAH, SDSS-V). This is just a lookup against the tracked-star list, not a positional or name match, so it's the most reliable method.</li>
    <li><b>name_resolved</b> — no Gaia column, but the archive's reported target name matches one of a tracked star's cached SIMBAD aliases. Tried <i>before</i> position deliberately: Gaia's single-star astrometric solution can be biased for close visual binaries, which can break a positional match even with otherwise-correct proper motion — an identifier match sidesteps that failure mode entirely. Still sanity-checked against the record's own reported position when one is present (within 10 arcmin) — a name match whose own position is nowhere near that star falls through to positional matching instead of being trusted blindly.</li>
    <li><b>positional_easy_match</b> — no Gaia column and no name match (or a name match that failed the sanity check above). The record's reported RA/Dec is checked against tracked stars only (not the full Gaia catalog), each candidate's proper motion propagated to the observation's epoch, within a fixed 1.0 arcsecond radius. Exactly one candidate within radius → matched. More than one → <b>needs_review</b> (ambiguous, gaia_source_id left unassigned). Zero → recorded as <b>skipped</b> (see below) rather than dropped — unless a name match was rejected just above, in which case it's <b>needs_review</b> instead: a rejected name match is often still correct (e.g. the archive's own logged position for that one exposure is simply wrong), so it's kept visible for confirmation rather than dropped with no candidate at all.</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="note">The 1.0" match radius is the same for every archive and instrument. Some instruments have a real, documented systematic offset between their reported pointing and the true catalog position (e.g. finder-camera-derived coordinates) — if that offset ever exceeds 1.0", the record ends up in the skipped queue rather than getting mismatched (the tight radius protects against false positives, at the cost of some real holdings not surfacing automatically).</p>

  <h2>What's likely missing</h2>
  <p>This is a "pointer" database, not a spectra archive — it tracks whether an archive has a spectrum for a star and links to it, not the spectrum data (flux/wavelength arrays) itself. A few concrete, known gaps beyond that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Archives and instruments not yet tracked</b>: see the Archive Status tab's Known gaps table (whole archives not yet public or investigated, like WEAVE/4MOST/JUST, and specific instruments at already-implemented archives like CARMENES's co-added template library).</li>
    <li><b>Name resolution gaps</b>: not every archive-reported target name resolves to a tracked star via SIMBAD, and it varies a lot by archive — some archives (e.g. NOIRLab) report a much higher fraction of unresolvable names than others, often because the reported name is a survey-internal field ID or calibration marker rather than an actual star name. These records aren't dropped: they're persisted with match_status <b>skipped</b> so they can be manually or crowd-sourced attached to a real Gaia source later. See the Skipped records section below for live, per-archive counts.</li>
    <li><b>Gaia XP continuous spectra</b>: flagged as available per-star (see the "Gaia XP continuous" field on a star's page) but not ingested as data — same lean-pointer tradeoff as everything else here.</li>
    <li><b>SDSS legacy vs. SDSS-V</b>: legacy optical spectroscopy is capped at MJD 58932 (~2020); anything after that boundary lives in the separate SDSS-V optical archive instead, on a different pipeline.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="note">See the Archive Status tab for when each archive was last synced, a per-archive match breakdown, and the known-gaps table; the Instruments tab for the tracked-instruments/resolving-power breakdown; and the Leaderboard tab for catalog-wide holdings-by-archive and matches-by-method breakdowns.</p>

  <h2>How reduction status is tracked</h2>
  <p>Each holding carries a coarse <b>raw</b> / <b>reduced</b> / <b>unknown</b> label in its "Reduction" column (see the tables below), deliberately simplified from the underlying IVOA ObsCore <code>calib_level</code> scale (0=raw telemetry, 1=instrument-signature-removed, 2=calibrated to standard units, 3=enhanced/combined) — anything above level 1 is bucketed as "reduced" here. This is only set when an archive's sync module has good grounds to know it; otherwise it's left as <b>unknown</b> rather than guessed. Three ways it gets set:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>From a real calib_level column</b>: for archives queried via ObsCore/TAP (ESO, CFHT/CADC, DAO, Gemini, OIRSA, MAST, MAST/JWST), the archive reports calib_level per record and it's mapped directly.</li>
    <li><b>Hardcoded, because the archive's access path only ever serves one kind of product</b>: survey pipeline archives with no raw counterpart (SDSS legacy/V, LAMOST, LAMOST MRS, GALAH, RAVE, DESI, Gemini GHOST/IGRINS via GOA) are marked <b>reduced</b>. KOA and <b>NOIRLab</b> are marked <b>raw</b> — NOIRLab's sync query explicitly filters to <code>proc_type = "raw"</code> at the source, so every NOIRLab record this project has ever ingested is an unreduced exposure; there are no reduced NOIRLab spectra to find here, by construction of the query rather than a gap in tracking.</li>
    <li><b>Derived from the file itself</b>: NAOJ inspects the access URL/format of each product to infer raw vs. reduced.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="note">A handful of archives don't set this field yet, so their holdings sit at <b>unknown</b> even where the true status is actually known with confidence — most notably <b>HARPS-N (TNG)</b>: every record synced from it is a raw exposure (the sync module already dedupes on the raw, unprocessed FITS filename specifically to avoid double-counting each DRS pipeline data product as a separate observation), but that fact isn't yet propagated into the reduction_status field. BeSS is a softer case worth flagging in the other direction: it's marked <b>reduced</b>, but that only means wavelength-calibrated, not flux-calibrated — a real but weaker claim than the "reduced" label implies for e.g. an ESO calib_level-2 spectrum. Treat "unknown" as "not yet recorded," not as "confirmed unclassifiable."</p>
  <p class="note"><b>ESO Science Archive</b> (Phase 3, pipeline-reduced) and <b>ESO Archive (Raw)</b> (unreduced exposures) are two separate archive_codes because a substantial slice of ESO's holdings — tens of thousands of raw HARPS/UVES/ESPRESSO frames per well-observed target — has no Phase 3 counterpart at all. Since the two source tables share no join key, a periodic reconciliation pass deletes any raw holding whose instrument and observation date match an already-synced Phase 3 holding for the same star, so a raw exposure disappears once ESO deposits its reduced counterpart rather than double-counting the same observation twice.</p>

  <h2>Needs-review queue</h2>
  <p class="note">Either an ambiguous positional match (2+ tracked stars fell within the 1.0" radius of the archive's reported position) or a name match rejected as implausible with no positional candidate to fall back on (see How matching works above) — in both cases no single star was assigned automatically. Most recent {{ needs_review|length }} shown{% if needs_review_total > needs_review|length %} of {{ "{:,}".format(needs_review_total) }} total{% endif %}.</p>

# scripts.export_to_parquet already publishes the Parquet snapshot to) over
# a narrowly-scoped SSH connection, and only actually land in

# across the pool -- named groups still always sort before nameless ones
# (matches triage_queue's own priority, no reason to ever invert that), but
# within each of those two tiers the order is a weighted random shuffle

# ascending) so a group with many underlying records is *more likely* to
# surface early without being pinned to the exact same n_records-DESC order

# so on) so groups that already have enough independent eyes on them fade
# from rotation and under-covered ones surface more -- a soft nudge rather
# than a hard cutoff, since nothing here excludes a name outright once it
# hits that target (submitters can disagree, and a third opinion is still
# useful; there's also no quorum-consuming apply step wired up yet for this
# to gate, see the /triage page's own note).
